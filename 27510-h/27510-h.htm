<h3><i><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></i></h3>

<p>That which we call 'The Bible' has the outward appearance
of a book: in reality it is&mdash;what the word 'bible'
implies in the original Greek&mdash;a whole library. More
than fifty books, the production of a large number of different
authors, representing periods of time extending over
many centuries, are all comprehended between the covers
of a single volume. There is no greater monument of
the power of printing to diffuse thought than this fact,
that the whole classic literature of one of the world's
greatest peoples can be carried about in the hand or the
pocket.</p>

<p>But there is another side to the matter. A high price
has been paid for this feat of manufacturing a portable
literature: no less a price than the effacement from the
books of the Bible of their whole literary structure.
Where the literature is dramatic, there are (except in one
book) no names of speakers nor divisions of speeches;
there are no titles to essays or poems, nor anything to
mark where one poem or discourse ends and another
begins; not only is there nothing to reflect finer rhythmic
distinctions in poetry, but (in King James's version) there
is not even a distinction made between poetry and prose.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
It is as if the whole were printed 'solid,' like a newspaper
without the newspaper headings. The most familiar
English literature treated in this fashion would lose a great
part of its literary interest; the writings of the Hebrews
suffer still more through our unfamiliarity with many of the
literary forms in which they are cast. Even this statement
does not fully represent the injury done to the literature
of the Bible by the traditional shape in which it is presented
to us. Between the Biblical writers and our own
times have intervened ages in which all interest in literary
beauty was lost, and philosophic activity took the form of
protracted discussions of brief sayings or 'texts.' Accordingly
this solidified matter of Hebrew literature has been
divided up into single sentences or 'verses,' numbered
mechanically one, two, three, etc., and thus the original
literary form has still further been obscured. It is not
surprising that to most readers the Bible has become, not
a literature, but simply a storehouse of pious 'texts.'</p>

<p>If the sacred Scriptures then are to be appreciated as
literature, it is necessary to restore their literary form and
structure. To do this, with all the assistance that the
modern printed page gives to the reader, is the aim of
the 'Modern Reader's Bible.' The present volume is
intended as an introduction to the series, and, it is hoped,
to the literary study of the Bible in general, by Select Masterpieces,
illustrating the different types of literature represented
in Scripture.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is natural to enquire, What are the leading literary
forms under which the sacred writings may be classified?</p>

<p>A large proportion of the Bible is History: the History
of the People of Israel as presented by themselves. How
Israel is chosen from all the nations to be the special
people of Jehovah; how the invisible Jehovah is at first
their only ruler; how gradually the spirit of assimilation
to surrounding nations leads to a demand for visible kings.
Just as this tendency to secular kingship becomes strong,
there comes into prominence an order of 'prophets': the
word signifies 'interpreters,' and the prophets are accepted
as the interpreters of Jehovah's will to Israel. Under such
rule as that of David, the man after God's own heart, the
work of the prophets may fall into the background; but
where, as usually happened, the secular government tends
to ungodliness, the order of prophets stands forth as an
organised opposition.  On lines like these the historic
narrative of the Bible pursues its course; and with the
thread of narrative are interwoven legal and statistical
documents which give it support. The History Series of
the Modern Reader's Bible presents the sacred narrative
divided according to its logical divisions. <i>Genesis</i> is occupied
with the formation of the chosen nation, from the
first beginnings of things to the development of the descendants
of Abraham as a patriarchal family. <i>The Exodus</i>
narrates the migration of the fully formed nation to
the land of promise; this is the period of constitutional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
development, and in this part of the history we find
massed together the whole of the constitutional lore of
Israel. The group of books constituting <i>The Judges</i>
volume represents a period of transition: the 'judges' of
Israel correspond to the 'heroes' of other peoples, and
amid a succession of these judges the incidents of Israel's
history reveal the efforts of the people of Jehovah towards
a secular government. <i>The Kings</i> takes up the history of
the nation from the establishment of the dynasty of David,
and covers the struggle between the prophetic and the
secular parties until the time of the fall and captivity.
Upon the return of the remnant from Babylon all opposition
to the theocracy has ceased; to the prophets have
succeeded the 'scribes,' or interpreters of the written law,
and <i>The Chronicles</i> is the ecclesiastical history, not of a
Hebrew nation, but of a Jewish church.</p>

<p>From History we must, in literary analysis, distinguish
Story: the one is founded on the sense of record and
scientific explanation of events, the other appeals to the
imagination and the emotions. The Story literature of
most peoples is 'fiction,' in the sense that its matter is
invented solely for literary purposes. The stories of the
Bible are part of the sacred history, differing only in the
mode in which the matter is presented; and a long series
of these stories is scattered through the historical books,
with nothing to distinguish them, in the ordinary versions,
from the historic context. In the volumes of this series
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the distinction is made by titles; the reader can thus, without
difficulty, bring to each of these varieties of literature
the kind of attention it requires; it is further possible, and
highly desirable, for him to make a separate study of Scriptural
Story. History it is not easy to illustrate by selections;
but the stories of the sacred books are represented
in the present volume by typical specimens.</p>

<p>One book that has a place in the historic sequence of
the Bible introduces us in reality to a different class of
literature&mdash;Oratory. <i>Deuteronomy</i> is made up of the
Orations (and Songs) of Moses, constituting his Farewell
to the People of Israel. It is oratory in the fullest sense
of the term, representing the words as they may be supposed
to come direct from the speaker. For the most part
however the sacred literature of oratory is of a different
kind; not exact reports of spoken words, but the substance,
it may be, of several similar speeches worked up afresh into
a form of written discourse. In this wider sense, the oratorical
literature of the Bible is of considerable extent; it
includes the prophetic discourses, and reflects the fervid
contests over first principles of righteousness which constituted
the main life of Israel. The principal varieties
of Biblical oratory are illustrated in this volume.</p>

<p>Philosophy has an important place in Scripture. The
word however is not there used to describe a division of
literature, but the sacred philosophy is called 'wisdom,'&mdash;a
term suggestive of its close application to matters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
human life and duty. This Wisdom literature started
from the 'proverbs'&mdash;simple thoughts conveyed in a
couplet or triplet of verse, which were collected together
by King Solomon and other of the wise men of Israel.
From these proverbs the form of wisdom enlarged to verse
epigrams and sonnets, or prose maxims and essays, until
we find books of wisdom comprehending complete systems
of thought. To catch the development of this Wisdom
literature, it is necessary to take in two books of 'The
Apocrypha'; a portion of sacred Scripture which in the
last century used to be bound up with Bibles, standing in
its historical position between the Old and New Testaments,
though now it is usually separated. In theology,
which is concerned with questions of authority, the distinction
between the Bible and the Apocrypha is fundamental:
the one is accepted as authoritative in matters of
faith, whereas the Apocryphal books are merely recommended
for devout reading. But in literary study the distinction
disappears; and two books of the Apocrypha are
of the highest literary importance,&mdash;<i>Ecclesiasticus</i> and <i>The
Wisdom of Solomon</i>. The Wisdom series of the Modern
Reader's Bible arranges the representative books of Biblical
philosophy in the order of its logical development.
<i>The Proverbs</i> is a Miscellany of Sayings and Poems, embodying
isolated observations of life. <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> is a
Miscellany including longer compositions, but still embodying
only isolated observations of life. In <i>Ecclesiastes</i> we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
find a connected series of writings, in which attempt is
made to solve the mystery of the universe: but the attempt
breaks down in despair. <i>The Wisdom of Solomon</i> renews
the attempt in the light of an immortal life beyond the
grave, and despair yields to serenity of spirit. The four
books thus reflect a philosophical advance. In <i>The Book
of Job</i>&mdash;one of the world's literary marvels&mdash;men's varying
attitudes towards the mystery of life are represented
in various speakers, and drawn together into a unity by
the movement of a dramatic plot. Such is the wisdom of
the sacred Scriptures viewed as a whole; in the present
volume it is only possible to illustrate the different forms,
whether of poetry or of prose, in which Biblical philosophy
is conveyed.</p>

<p>Biblical Lyrics may be mentioned next. Originally, all
poetry was spoken with musical accompaniment; when
this primitive literature began to divide up into specialised
forms, Lyric was the literary form which retained most of
the spirit of music. It includes Songs and Odes, in which
the very structure of the poem is determined by the mode
of its performance; Psalms and Lamentations; the Traditional
Poetry scattered through the historical books;
again, considerable portions of prophetic literature are
found to take a lyric form. Even in the ordinary versions
the Psalms and Lamentations retain something of their
poetic structure; the less obvious features of lyric rhythm
will be illustrated in the selections admitted into this volume.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the fundamental divisions of literature there yet
remains one&mdash;the Drama. The relation of this to the
Bible is interesting. It is impossible to read the scriptures
of the Old Testament without feeling that the genius
of the Hebrew people is strongly dramatic. Yet the natural
instrument for the expression of dramatic creations&mdash;the
theatre&mdash;is not a Hebrew institution. Accordingly
the dramatic instinct, denied its readiest outlet, is found to
leaven all other literary forms. We have already noticed
dramatic wisdom in <i>Job</i>. Dramatic lyrics are found, not
only in some of the psalms, but on a larger scale in the
love songs of Solomon.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But there is a more important
type of dramatic literature in the sacred Scriptures. The
prophets of Israel were not only statesmen and preachers,
they were also poets, and from them has come down to us
a form of spiritual drama to which may be given the name
'Rhapsody.'</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
This Lyric Idyl of 'Solomon's Song,' together with some narrated
stories of the same idyllic spirit, are united in a single volume of this series
under the name of <i>Biblical Idyls</i>.</p></div>

<p>These spiritual dramas of the prophets are occupied
with that fundamental topic of Hebrew thought which is
expressed by the word 'judgment': the eternal contest
between good and evil, and the Divine overthrow of
wrong. They are dramas which no actual theatre could
ever express, for their action covers all space and all time.
Their personages include not only the prophet and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
nation of Israel, but also God himself and the celestial
hosts. The working of events towards the judgment is
brought out before us with the general impression of
dramatic movement; but the means by which this movement
is realised go beyond the machinery of drama: not
only dialogue and monologue, but song and even discourse
are made to bear their part in the total effect. The grand
example of rhapsody which covers the latter part of our
<i>Book of Isaiah</i> can be represented in the present volume
only by its prelude and one of its seven acts or 'visions.'
But some of the shorter, and hardly less splendid, rhapsodies
are given in full; and the selections further illustrate
how a prophecy may set out as a simple discourse,
and suddenly rise to the level of rhapsodic presentation.</p>

<p>I believe few people realise what an immense addition
has been made to the literary patrimony of the English
reader by the Revised Version of the Bible, and such
other presentations of the sacred Scriptures as this Revised
Version has made possible. The language of Biblical
writers, and the sentences of which their writings are
made up, have long been familiar through the earlier versions;
the Revisers, by the attention they have given to
connectedness of thought, have carried forward translated
language into translated literature. It is thus open to a
person of average culture to add to his other mental
possessions the whole expression of itself which a great
people has made in poetry and prose throughout all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
periods of its development. With the exception of humorous
writing, which is foreign to the genius of the
ancient Hebrews, the whole range of literary production is
here illustrated; and varieties of literary form are presented
to which classic Greek or modern European writers furnish
no parallel. It is a literature numbering among its authors
some who&mdash;by critics entirely outside the ranks of theologians&mdash;have
been classed with the greatest names in the
world's roll of honour. More than this, the English reader
who gives attention to the literary side of the Bible is studying
what is to him ancestral literature. The Hebrew
writers of the Old Testament, and their followers the
Christian Hebrews of the New Testament, have been the
inspiration of those who have inspired our own writers:
their style has largely leavened the style of modern English,
their thought has become so closely interwoven with
English thought of the last three centuries that it is impossible
to sever the two. And, if the question be of
what is higher than literary impressions, no reader need
fear that the more sacred uses of the Bible will be imperilled
by his reading, not with the spirit only, but with the
understanding also.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>In this, as in the other volumes of this series, the text of
the Selections is that of the Revised Version, the marginal
alternatives being often substituted for the readings in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
text. For the use of this Revised Version I express my
obligation to the University Presses of Oxford and Cambridge.
A Reference Table at the end connects the Selections
with the volumes of the Modern Reader's Bible from
which they are taken, and with the chapters and verses of
the ordinary versions.

<p class="center"><i>JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN</i></p>

<p>And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings,
in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of
Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding
the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the
sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's
wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto
their father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his
children, because he was the son of his old age: and he
made him a coat of many colours. And his brethren saw
that their father loved him more than all his brethren;
and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto
him. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his
brethren: and they hated him yet the more. And he
said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed: for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field,
and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold,
your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance
to my sheaf. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou
indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion
over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams,
and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">[6]</a></span>
and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have
dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon
and eleven stars made obeisance to me. And he told it
to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked
him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed
come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying
in mind.</p>

<p>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren
feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto
them. And he said to him, Here am I. And he said to
him, Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren,
and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he
sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
And a certain man found him, and, behold, he
was wandering in a field: and the man asked him, saying,
What seekest thou? And he said, I seek my brethren:
tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.
And the man said, They are departed hence: for I heard
them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after
his brethren, and found them in Dothan. And they saw
him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they
conspired against him to slay him. And they said one to
another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now therefore,
and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">[7]</a></span>
and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and
we shall see what will become of his dreams. And Reuben
heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and
said, Let us not take his life. And Reuben said unto
them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the
wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver
him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his
brethren, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of
many colours that was on him; and they took him, and
cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was
no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread: and
they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling
company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their
camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to
carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren,
What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his
blood? Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let
not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh.
And his brethren hearkened unto him. And there passed
by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted
up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites
for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph
into Egypt. And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold,
Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is
not; and I, whither shall I go? And they took Joseph's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">[8]</a></span>
coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the
blood; and they sent the coat of many colours, and they
brought it to their father; and said, This have we found:
know now whether it be thy son's coat or not. And he
knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his
loins, and mourned for his son many days. And all his
sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he
refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down
to the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept
for him. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto
Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.</p>

<p>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar,
an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian,
bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, which
had brought him down thither. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with
Joseph and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the
house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with him, and that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made all
that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found
grace in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he
made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he
put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that
he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he
had, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian's house for
Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">[9]</a></span>
all that he had, in the house and in the field. And he
left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
aught that was with him, save the bread which he did
eat.</p>

<p>And Joseph was comely and well favoured. And it
came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast
her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. But
he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he
hath put all that he hath into my hand; there is none
greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife:
how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
God? And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day
by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or
to be with her. And it came to pass about this time, that
he went into the house to do his work; and there was none
of the men of the house there within. And she caught him
by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment
in her hand, and fled, and got him out. And it came
to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her
hand, and was fled forth, that she called unto the men
of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath
brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in
unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: and
it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">[10]</a></span>
got him out. And she laid up his garment by her, until
his master came home. And she spake unto him according
to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which
thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
he left his garment by me, and fled out. And it came to
pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which
she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. And Joseph's
master took him, and put him into the prison, the place
where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
in the prison. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with Joseph, and shewed
kindness unto him, and gave him favour in the sight of the
keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed
to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the
prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of
it. The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that
was under his hand, because the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with him; and
that which he did, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made it to prosper.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after these things, that the butler
of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the
king of Egypt. And Pharaoh was wroth against his two
officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the
chief of the bakers. And he put them in ward in the
house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place
where Joseph was bound. And the captain of the guard
charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">[11]</a></span>
and they continued a season in ward. And they dreamed
a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night,
each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were
bound in the prison. And Joseph came in unto them
in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were
sad. And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with
him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore
look ye so sadly today? And they said unto him, We
have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret
it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell it me, I pray you. And
the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; and in the
vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,
and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
brought forth ripe grapes: and Pharaoh's cup was in my
hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into
Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
the three branches are three days; within yet three days
shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto
thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his
hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well
with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and
make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">[12]</a></span>
this house: for indeed I was stolen away out of the land
of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon. When the chief
baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets
of white bread were on my head: and in the uppermost
basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh;
and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my
head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
thereof: the three baskets are three days; within
yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy
flesh from off thee. And it came to pass the third day,
which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto
all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief
butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: but he hanged
the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. Yet
did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that
Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
well favoured and fatfleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them
out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood
by the other kine upon the brink of the river. And the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">[13]</a></span>
ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. And he slept
and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of
corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold,
seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up
after them. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven
rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it
was a dream. And it came to pass in the morning that
his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the
magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and
Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that
could interpret them unto Pharaoh. Then spake the chief
butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this
day: Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in
ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the
chief baker: and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and
he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation
of his dream. And there was with us there a young man,
an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each
man according to his dream he did interpret. And it
came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought
him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself,
and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">[14]</a></span>
and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard
say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst
interpret it. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is
not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I
stood upon the brink of the river: and, behold, there came
up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured;
and they fed in the reed-grass: and, behold, seven other
kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and
leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
for badness: and the lean and ill favoured kine did eat up
the first seven fat kine: and when they had eaten them up,
it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they
were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up
upon one stalk, full and good: and, behold, seven ears,
withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up
after them: and the thin ears swallowed up the seven
good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there
was none that could declare it to me. And Joseph said
unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God
is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh. The seven
good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
seven years: the dream is one. And the seven lean
and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven
years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east
wind; they shall be seven years of famine, That is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">[15]</a></span>
thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about
to do he hath shewed unto Pharaoh. Behold, there
come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land
of Egypt: and there shall arise after them seven years of
famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of
Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; and the
plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice,
it is because the thing is established by God, and God will
shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore let Pharaoh look
out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of
Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers
over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land
of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. And let them
gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay
up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities,
and let them keep it. And the food shall be for a store to
the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be
in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the
famine.</p>

<p>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
the eyes of all his servants. And Pharaoh said unto his
servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom
the spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch
as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so
discreet and wise as thou: thou shalt be over my house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">[16]</a></span>
and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
only in the throne will I be greater than thou. And
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from
his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him
in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his
neck; and he made him to ride in the second chariot
which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee:
and he set him over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no
man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and
he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera
priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before
Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the
presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of
Egypt. And in the seven plenteous years the earth
brought forth by handfuls. And he gathered up all the
food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt,
and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field,
which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for it was without number.</p>

<p>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of
famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera
priest of On bare unto him. And Joseph called the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">[17]</a></span>
of the first born 'Manasseh': For, said he, God hath 'made
me forget' all my toil, and all my father's house. And the
name of the second called he 'Ephraim': For God hath
made me 'fruitful' in the land of my affliction.</p>

<p>And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of
Egypt, came to an end. And the seven years of famine
began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there
was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there
was bread. And when all the land of Egypt was famished,
the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said
unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to
you, do. And the famine was over all the face of the earth:
and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the
Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy
corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.</p>

<p>Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob
said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in
Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence;
that we may live, and not die. And Joseph's ten brethren
went down to buy corn from Egypt. But Benjamin,
Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he
said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. And the
sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for
the famine was in the land of Canaan. And Joseph was
the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">[18]</a></span>
people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and
bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the
earth. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them,
but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly
with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?
And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not
him. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he
dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to
see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they
said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants
come. We are all one man's sons; we are true
men, thy servants are no spies. And he said unto them,
Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the
sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the
youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. And
Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
saying, Ye are spies: hereby ye shall be proved: by the
life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your
youngest brother come hither. Send one of you, and let
him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your
words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or
else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. And he
put them all together into ward three days.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and
live; for I fear God: if ye be true men, let one of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">[19]</a></span>
brethren be bound in your prison house; but go ye, carry
corn for the famine of your houses: and bring your youngest
brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and
ye shall not die. And they did so. And they said one to
another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in
that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come
upon us. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I
not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye
would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
And they knew not that Joseph understood them;
for there was an interpreter between them. And he turned
himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to
them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among
them, and bound him before their eyes. Then Joseph commanded
to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every
man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for
the way: and thus was it done unto them. And they laded
their asses with their corn, and departed thence. And as
one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
the lodging place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was
in the mouth of his sack. And he said unto his brethren,
My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and
their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to
another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?</p>

<p>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of
Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them: saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">[20]</a></span>
The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and
took us for spies of the country. And we said unto him,
We are true men; we are no spies: we be twelve brethren,
sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this
day with our father in the land of Canaan. And the man,
the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know
that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren with me,
and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your
way: and bring your youngest brother unto me: then
shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men:
so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in
the land. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks,
that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack:
and when they and their father saw their bundles of money,
they were afraid. And Jacob their father said unto them,
Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and
Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these
things are against me. And Reuben spake unto his
father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to
thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to
thee again. And he said, My son shall not go down with
you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if mischief
befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall
ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>And the famine was sore in the land. And it came to
pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">[21]</a></span>
again, buy us a little food. And Judah spake unto him,
saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye
shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. If
thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and
buy thee food: but if thou wilt not send him, we will not
go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my
face, except your brother be with you. And Israel said,
Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother? And they said, The man
asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our
kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
words: could we in any wise know that he would say,
Bring your brother down? And Judah said unto Israel
his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go;
that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also
our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt
thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set
him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: for
except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a
second time. And their father Israel said unto them, If it
be so now, do this; take of the choice fruits of the land in
your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little
balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and
almonds: and take double money in your hand; and the
money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry
again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">[22]</a></span>
take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that
he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin.
And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</p>

<p>And the men took that present, and they took double
money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and
went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. And when
Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of
his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and
make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought
the men into Joseph's house. And the men were afraid,
because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they
said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks
at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for
bondmen, and our asses. And they came near to the
steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the
door of the house, and said, Oh my lord, we came indeed
down at the first time to buy food: and it came to pass,
when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our
sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth
of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought
it again in our hand. And other money have we brought
down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our
money in our sacks. And he said, Peace be to you, fear
not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">[23]</a></span>
you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he
brought Simeon out unto them. And the man brought
the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and
they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>

<p>And they made ready the present against Joseph came
at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present
which was in their hand into the house, and bowed
down themselves to him to the earth. And he asked them
of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man
of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? And they said, Thy
servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed
the head, and made obeisance. And he lifted up his eyes,
and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said,
Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me?
And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. And
Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered
into his chamber, and wept there. And he washed his
face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said,
Set on bread. And they set on for him by himself, and for
them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat
with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might
not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination
unto the Egyptians. And they sat before him, the
firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest
according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">[24]</a></span>
another. And he took and sent messes unto them from
before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much
as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with
him.</p>

<p>And he commanded the steward of his house, saying,
Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry,
and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. And put
my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
and his corn money. And he did according to the
word that Joseph had spoken. As soon as the morning
was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
And when they were gone out of the city, and were not
yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after
the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto
them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? Is not
this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed
divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. And he overtook
them, and he spake unto them these words. And
they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such
words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do
such a thing. Behold, the money, which we found in our
sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land
of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's
house silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants
it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
And he said, Now also let it be according unto
your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">[25]</a></span>
and ye shall be blameless. Then they hasted, and
took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened
every man his sack. And he searched, and began at the
eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in
Benjamin's sack. Then they rent their clothes, and laded
every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>

<p>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house;
and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the
ground. And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this
that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can
indeed divine? And Judah said, What shall we say unto
my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:
behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in
whose hand the cup is found. And he said, God forbid
that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is
found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up
in peace unto your father.</p>

<p>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord,
let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears,
and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou
art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked his servants, saying,
Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto my
lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old
age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
left of his mother, and his father loveth him. And thou
saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">[26]</a></span>
may set mine eyes upon him. And we said unto my lord,
The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his
father, his father would die. And thou saidst unto thy
servants, Except your youngest brother come down with
you, ye shall see my face no more. And it came to pass
when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him
the words of my lord. And our father said, Go again, buy
us a little food. And we said, We cannot go down: if our
youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we
may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother
be with us. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye
know that my wife bare me two sons: and the one went
out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I
have not seen him since: and if ye take this one also from
me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave. Now therefore when I
come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us;
seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; it shall
come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,
that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the
grave. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto
my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall
I bear the blame to my father for ever. Now therefore,
let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a
bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">[27]</a></span>
not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my
father.</p>

<p>Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them
that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go
out from me. And there stood no man with him, while
Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he
wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of
Pharaoh heard. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am
Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could
not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I
pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am
Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt. And now
be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me
hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and
there are yet five years in the which there shall be neither
plowing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve
you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by
a great deliverance. So now it was not you that sent me
hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh,
and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of
Egypt. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto
him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of
all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: and thou shalt
dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto
me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">[28]</a></span>
and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: and
there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of
famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household,
and all that thou hast. And, behold, your eyes see, and
the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that
speaketh unto you. And ye shall tell my father of all my
glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall
haste and bring down my father hither. And he fell upon
his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin
wept upon his neck. And he kissed all his brethren, and
wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with
him.</p>

<p>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh
well, and his servants. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and
go, get you unto the land of Canaan; and take your father
and your households, and come unto me: and I will give
you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
of the land. Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take
you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones,
and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. Also
regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt
is yours. And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave
them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
and gave them provision for the way. To all of them he
gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">[29]</a></span>
gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of
raiment. And to his father he sent after this manner; ten
asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses,
laden with corn and bread and victual for his father
by the way. So he sent his brethren away, and they departed:
and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by
the way.</p>

<p>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land
of Canaan unto Jacob their father. And they told him,
saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land
of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them
not. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he
had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which
Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their
father revived: and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my
son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</p>

<p>And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and
came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God
of his father Isaac. And God spake unto Israel in the
visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he
said, Here am I. And he said, I am God, the God of
thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will
there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with
thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up
again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of
Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">[30]</a></span>
and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent
to carry him. And they took their cattle, and their goods,
which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came
into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: his sons,
and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
Egypt.</p>

<p>And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to shew
the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into
the land of Goshen. And Joseph made ready his chariot,
and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he
presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept
on his neck a good while. And Israel said unto Joseph,
Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art
yet alive. And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto
his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will
say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which
were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; and the
men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle;
and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and
all that they have. And it shall come to pass, when
Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers
of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our
fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for
every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">[31]</a></span>
father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds,
and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan;
and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. And from
among his brethren he took five men, and presented them
unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren,
What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh,
Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are
we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks;
for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now, therefore,
we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of
Goshen. And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy
father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of
Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
father and thy brethren to dwell: in the land of Goshen
let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among
them, then make them rulers over my cattle. And Joseph
brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh:
and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto
Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of
my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and
evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they
have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of
my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. And Jacob
blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of
Pharaoh. And Joseph placed his father and his brethren,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">[32]</a></span>
and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the
best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had
commanded. And Joseph nourished his father, and his
brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according
to their families.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="The_Witness_of_Balaam_to_Israel" id="The_Witness_of_Balaam_to_Israel"></a><i>II</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>THE WITNESS OF BALAAM TO ISRAEL</i></p>

<p>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done
to the Amorites. And Moab was sore afraid of the people,
because they were many: and Moab was distressed because
of the children of Israel. And Moab said unto the elders
of Midian, Now shall this multitude lick up all that is
round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.
And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that
time. And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of
Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the
children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is
a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the
face of the earth, and they abide over against me: come
now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they
are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the
land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed,
and he whom thou cursest is cursed. And the elders of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">[33]</a></span>
Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards
of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam,
and spake unto him the words of Balak. And he said unto
them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word
again, as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall speak unto me: and the princes
of Moab abode with Balaam. And God came unto
Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? And
Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, Behold, the people that
is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth:
now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able
to fight against them, and shall drive them out. And God
said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. And
Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
of Balak, Get you into your land: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> refuseth to
give me leave to go with you.</p>

<p>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto
Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. And
Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
than they. And they came to Balaam, and said to him,
Thus saith Balak, the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I
pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: for I will
promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever
thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray
thee, curse me this people. And Balaam answered and
said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">[34]</a></span>
me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond
the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more. Now
therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
I may know what the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will speak unto me more. And
God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
men be come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only
the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>

<p>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his
ass, and went with the princes of Moab. And God's
anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> placed himself in the way for an adversary against
him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two
servants were with him. And the ass saw the angel of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> standing in the way, with his sword drawn in
his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and
went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her
into the way. Then the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood in a
hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this
side, and a fence on that side. And the ass saw the
angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and she thrust herself unto the wall,
and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote
her again. And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> went further,
and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn
either to the right hand or to the left. And the ass saw
the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and she lay down under Balaam:
and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass
with his staff. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">[35]</a></span>
ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto
thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? And
Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me:
I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now I had
killed thee. And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I
thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long
unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And
he said, Nay. Then the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened the eyes of
Balaam, and he saw the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> standing in the
way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed his
head, and fell on his face. And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass
these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary,
because thy way is perverse before me: and the ass
saw me, and turned aside before me these three times:
unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had
even slain thee, and saved her alive. And Balaam said
unto the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have sinned; for I knew not
that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if
it displease thee, I will get me back again. And the angel
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only
the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt
speak.</p>

<p>So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. And when
Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
him unto the city of Moab, which is on the border of
Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">[36]</a></span>
Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto
thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am
I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? And
Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
now any power at all to speak anything? the word that
God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>

<p>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto
Kiriath-huzoth. And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep,
and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took
Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal,
and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.
And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars,
and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. And
Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. And Balaam
said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will
go; peradventure the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will come to meet me: and
whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went
to a bare height. And God met Balaam: and he said
unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have
offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. And he returned unto
him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, he, and all
the princes of Moab. And he took up his parable, and
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">From Aram hath Balak brought me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, curse me Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And come, defy Israel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how shall I defy, whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath not defied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For from the top of the rocks I see him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from the hills I behold him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, it is a people that dwell alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall not be reckoned among the nations.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can count the dust of Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or number the fourth part of Israel?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me die the death of the righteous,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let my last end be like his!<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto
me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou
hast blessed them altogether. And he answered and said,
Must I not take heed to speak that which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> putteth
in my mouth?</p>

<p>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me
unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them;
thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not
see them all: and curse me them from thence. And he took
him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built
seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every
altar. And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">[38]</a></span>
offering, while I meet the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> yonder. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return
unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. And he came to
him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and the
princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him,
What hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spoken? And he took up his
parable, and said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">Rise up, Balak, and hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God is not a man, that he should lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither the son of man, that he should repent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he said, and shall he not do it?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, I have received commandment to bless:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God is with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the shout of a king is among them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bringeth them forth out of Egypt;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither is there any divination against Israel:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">[39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as a lion doth he lift himself up:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drink the blood of the slain.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all,
nor bless them at all. But Balaam answered and said
unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
speaketh, that I must do?</p>

<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee
unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
thou mayest curse me them from thence. And Balak took
Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the
desert. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven
altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock
and a ram on every altar. And when Balaam saw
that it pleased the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to bless Israel, he went not, as at
the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his
face toward the wilderness. And Balaam lifted up his
eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes;
and the spirit of God came upon him. And he took up
his parable, and said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">Balaam the son of Beor saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the man whose eye is opened saith:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which seeth the vision of the Almighty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Falling down, and having his eyes open:<br /></span></p>

<p><span class="i0">How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy tabernacles, O Israel!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As valleys are they spread forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As gardens by the river side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As lign-aloes which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath planted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As cedar trees beside the waters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Water shall flow from his buckets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his seed shall be in many waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his king shall be higher than Agag,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his kingdom shall be exalted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bringeth him forth out of Egypt;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall break their bones in pieces,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And smite them through with his arrows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He couched, he lay down as a lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed be every one that blesseth thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cursed be every one that curseth thee.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he
smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I
called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
altogether blessed them these three times. Therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">[41]</a></span>
now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, lo, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath kept thee back
from honour. And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not
also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
cannot go beyond the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do either good
or bad of mine own mind; what the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> speaketh, that
will I speak? And now, behold, I go unto my people:
come, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do
to thy people in the latter days. And he took up his parable,
and said:</p>

<span class="i0">I see him, but not now:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I behold him, but not nigh:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall come forth a star out of Jacob,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And out of Jacob shall one have dominion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall destroy the remnant from the city.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and
said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">Amalek was the first of the nations;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But his latter end shall come to destruction.<br /></span>

<p>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and
said:</p>

<span class="i0">Strong is thy dwelling place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thy nest is set in the rock.<br /></span>

<p>And he took up his parable, and said:</p>

<span class="i0">Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And he also shall come to destruction.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place:
and Balak also went his way.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="The_Crowning_of_Abimelech" id="The_Crowning_of_Abimelech"></a><i>III</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>THE CROWNING OF ABIMELECH</i></p>

<p>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his
own house. And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of
his body begotten: for he had many wives. And his concubine
that was in Sechem, she also bare him a son, and
he called his name Abimelech. And Gideon the son of
Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the
sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that
the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring
after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. And
the children of Israel remembered not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their
God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their
enemies on every side: neither shewed they kindness to
the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all
the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</p>

<p>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem
unto his mother's brethren, and spake with them, and with
all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal,
which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or
that one rule over you? remember also that I am your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">[44]</a></span>
bone and your flesh. And his mother's brethren spake
of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these
words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for
they said, He is our brother. And they gave him threescore
and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith,
wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows,
which followed him. And he went unto his father's house
at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal,
being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but
Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he
hid himself.</p>

<p>And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves
together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made
Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in
Shechem. And when they told it to Jotham, he went and
stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice,
and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men
of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. The trees
went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they
said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But the olive
tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith
by me they honour God and man, and go to wave to and
fro over the trees? And the trees said to the fig tree,
Come thou, and reign over us. But the fig tree said unto
them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and
go to wave to and fro over the trees? And the trees said
unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. And the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">[45]</a></span>
vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the
trees? Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come
thou, and reign over us. And the bramble said unto the
trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come
and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come
out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that
ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well
with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him
according to the deserving of his hands;&mdash;for my father
fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you
out of the hand of Midian: and ye are risen up against
my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore
and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made
Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men
of Shechem, because he is your brother;&mdash;if ye then have
dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house
this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also
rejoice in you: but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech,
and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of
Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem,
and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech. And
Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</p>

<p>And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. And
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">[46]</a></span>
of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously
with Abimelech: that the violence done to the threescore
and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood
might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew
them, and upon the men of Shechem, which strengthened
his hands to slay his brethren. And the men of Shechem
set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and
they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it
was told Abimelech.</p>

<p>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and
went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their
trust in him. And they went out into the field, and gathered
their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and held festival,
and went into the house of their god, and did eat and
drink, and cursed Abimelech. And Gaal the son of Ebed
said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we
should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and
Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father
of Shechem; but why should we serve him? And would
to God this people were under my hand! then would I
remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase
thine army, and come out. And when Zebul the ruler of
the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his
anger was kindled. And he sent messengers unto Abimelech
craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his
brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain
the city to take part against thee. Now therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">[47]</a></span>
up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie
in wait in the field: and it shall be, that in the morning,
as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon
the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with
him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them
as thou shalt find occasion.</p>

<p>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were
with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in
four companies. And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and
stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech
rose up, and the people that were with him, from the
ambushment. And when Gaal saw the people, he said to
Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of
the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the
shadow of the mountains as if they were men. And Gaal
spake again and said, See, there come people down by the
middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way
of the oak of Meonenim. Then said Zebul unto him,
Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech,
that we should serve him? is not this the people that
thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with
them. And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem,
and fought with Abimelech. And Abimelech chased him,
and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even
unto the entering of the gate. And Abimelech dwelt at
Arumah: and Zebul drave out Gaal and his brethren, that
they should not dwell in Shechem. And it came to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">[48]</a></span>
on the morrow, that the people went out into the field;
and they told Abimelech. And he took the people, and
divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the
field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth
out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote
them. And Abimelech, and the companies that were with
him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate
of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that
were in the field, and smote them. And Abimelech fought
against the city all that day; and he took the city, and
slew the people that was therein: and he beat down the
city, and sowed it with salt.</p>

<p>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard
thereof, they entered into the hold of the house of Elberith.
And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the
tower of Shechem were gathered together. And Abimelech
gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his
hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it
up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the
people that were with him, What ye have seen me do,
make haste, and do as I have done. And all the people
likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed
Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of
Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</p>

<p>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">[49]</a></span>
Thebez, and took it. But there was a strong tower within
the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all
they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up
to the roof of the tower. And Abimelech came unto the
tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door
of the tower to burn it with fire. And a certain woman
cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and brake
his skull. Then he called hastily unto the young man his
armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill
me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his
young man thrust him through, and he died. And when
the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
every man unto his place. Thus God requited the
wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in
slaying his seventy brethren: and all the wickedness of the
men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and
upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Samsons_Wedding_Feast" id="Samsons_Wedding_Feast"></a><i>IV</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>SAMSON'S WEDDING FEAST</i></p>

<p>And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman
in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. And he
came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I
have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">[50]</a></span>
Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. Then
his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never
a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among
all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
Philistines? And Samson said unto his father,
Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. But his father
and his mother knew not that it was of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for he
sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that
time the Philistines had rule over Israel. Then went
Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah,
and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a
young lion roared against him. And the spirit of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he
would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand:
but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
And he went down and talked with the woman; and she
pleased Samson well. And after a while he returned to
take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the
lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body
of the lion, and honey. And he took it into his hands,
and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father
and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but
he told them not that he had taken the honey out of
the body of the lion. And his father went down unto the
woman: and Samson made there a feast: for so used the
young men to do. And it came to pass, when they saw
him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">[51]</a></span>
And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a
riddle unto you: if ye can declare it me within the seven
days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
linen garments and thirty changes of raiment: but if ye
cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen
garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said
unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. And
he said unto them,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">Out of the eater came forth meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of the strong came forth sweetness.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And they could not in three days declare the riddle. And
it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare
unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house
with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not so?
And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost
but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a
riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it
me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my
father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee? And she
wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her,
because she pressed him sore: and she told the riddle to
the children of her people. And the men of the city said
unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">[52]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">What is sweeter than honey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what is stronger than a lion?<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And he said unto them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">If ye had not plowed with my heifer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye had not found out my riddle.<br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>And the spirit of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and
he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them,
and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment
unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was
kindled, and he went up to his father's house. But Samson's
wife was given to his companion, whom he had
used as his friend.</p>

<p>But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he
said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her
father would not suffer him to go in. And her father said,
I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore
I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of
her. And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be
blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a
mischief. And Samson went and caught three hundred
foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put
a firebrand in the midst between every two tails. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">[53]</a></span>
when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both
the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards.
Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And
they said, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because
he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion.
And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father
with fire. And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this
manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I
will cease. And he smote them hip and thigh with a
great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft
of the rock of Etam.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE EXPEDITION AGAINST ELISHA</i></p>

<p>Now the king of Syria warred against Israel: and he
took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a
place shall be my camp. And the man of God sent unto
the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such
a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down. And
the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there,
not once nor twice. And the heart of the king of Syria
was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants,
and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">[54]</a></span>
us is for the king of Israel? And one of his servants said,
Nay, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in
Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest
in thy bedchamber. And he said, Go and see where
he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him,
saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. Therefore sent he thither
horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by
night, and compassed the city about. And when the servant
of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth,
behold, an host with horses and chariots was round about
the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master!
how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not: for they
that be with us are more than they that be with them. And
Elisha prayed, and said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I pray thee, open his eyes,
that he may see. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened the eyes of the
young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was
full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.
And he smote them with blindness according to the
word of Elisha. And Elisha said unto them, This is not
the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring
you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria,
that Elisha said, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, open the eyes of these men,
that they may see. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> opened their eyes, and
they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">[55]</a></span>
And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw
them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest
thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy
sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them,
that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. And
he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to
their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into
the land of Israel.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="The_Dream_of_the_Tree_cut_down" id="The_Dream_of_the_Tree_cut_down"></a><i>VI</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>THE DREAM OF THE TREE CUT DOWN</i></p>

<p>'Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations,
and languages, that dwell in all the earth: peace be multiplied
unto you. It hath seemed good unto me to shew
the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath
wrought toward me. How great are his signs! and how
mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</p>

<p>'I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing
in my palace. I saw a dream which made me
afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of
my head troubled me. Therefore made I a decree to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">[56]</a></span>
bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they
might make known unto me the interpretation of the
dream. Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the
Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream
before them; but they did not make known unto me the
interpretation thereof. But at the last Daniel came in
before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to
the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy
gods: and I told the dream before him, saying, O Belteshazzar,
master of the magicians, because I know that
the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth
thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen,
and the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p>'Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw,
and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height
thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and
the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight
thereof to the end of all the earth. The leaves thereof
were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat
for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and
the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and
all flesh was fed of it. I saw in the visions of my head
upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came
down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: "Hew
down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves,
and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it,
and the fowls from his branches. Nevertheless leave the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">[57]</a></span>
stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron
and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be
wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with
the beasts in the grass of the earth: let his heart be
changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto
him; and let seven times pass over him. The sentence
is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the
word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may
know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it
the lowest of men." This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar
have seen: and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation,
forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom
are not able to make known unto me the interpretation;
but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p>

<p>'Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied
for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king
answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the
interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and
said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and
the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. The tree
that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to
all the earth; whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof
much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts
of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of
the heaven had their habitation; it is thou, O king, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">[58]</a></span>
art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown,
and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end
of the earth. And whereas the king saw a watcher and
an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew
down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the
stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band
of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let
it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be
with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of
the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall
be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to
eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven,
and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that
the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth
it to whomsoever he will. And whereas they commanded
to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be
sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the
heavens do rule. Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be
acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness,
and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor;
if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</p>

<p>'All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. At the
end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace
of Babylon. The king spake and said, Is not this great
Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">[59]</a></span>
by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell
a voice from heaven, saying: "O king Nebuchadnezzar,
to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee.
And thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling
shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made
to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee;
until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom
of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." The same
hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he
was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was
grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up
mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned
unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and
honoured him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an
everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to
generation: and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed
as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the
army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth:
and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest
thou? At the same time mine understanding returned
unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty
and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and
my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my
kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the
King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways
judgement: and those that walk in pride he is able to
abase.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Belshazzars_Feast" id="Belshazzars_Feast"></a><i>VII</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST</i></p>

<p>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of
his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar,
whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring
the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his
father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem;
that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines,
might drink therein. Then they brought the
golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the
house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and
his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank in them.
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of
silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. In the same
hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over
against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
wrote. Then the king's countenance was changed in him,
and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">[61]</a></span>
The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to
the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be
clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his
neck, and shall rule as one of three in the kingdom. Then
came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the
writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.</p>

<p>Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and
his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake
and said: O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts
trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: there
is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy
gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding
and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in
him: and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king,
I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians,
enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; forasmuch as an
excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting
of dreams, and shewing of dark sentences, and
dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom
the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called,
and he will shew the interpretation.</p>

<p>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The
king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">[62]</a></span>
which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom
the king my father brought out of Judah? I have heard
of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that
light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in
thee. And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been
brought in before me, that they should read this writing,
and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but
they could not shew the interpretation of the thing. But
I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations,
and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing,
and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou
shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold
about thy neck, and shalt rule as one of three in the kingdom.
Then Daniel answered and said before the king:
Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another;
nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and
make known to him the interpretation. O thou king, the
Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the
kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty: and
because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples,
nations, and languages trembled and feared before him:
whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept
alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he
would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up,
and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was
deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory
from him: and he was driven from the sons of men; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">[63]</a></span>
his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was
with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and
his body was wet with the dew of heaven: until he knew
that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will. And thou
his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this: but hast lifted up thyself
against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the
vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords,
thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them;
and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass,
iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know:
and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are
all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: then was the part of
the hand sent from before him, and this writing was
inscribed. And this is the writing that was inscribed<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>:</p>

<p class="center" style="font-family:courier"><i>M&nbsp;&nbsp;U&nbsp;&nbsp;P</i></p>

<p class="center" style="font-family:courier"><i>N&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;N</i></p>

<p>This is the interpretation of the thing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel
with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and
made proclamation concerning him, that he should rule as
one of three in the kingdom. In that night Belshazzar the
Chaldean king was slain. And Darius the Mede received
the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
unto the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to observe to
do all his commandments which I command thee this day,
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God will set thee on high above all the
nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come
upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto
the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in
the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed
shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground,
and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and
the young of thy flock. Blessed shall be thy basket and
thy kneadingtrough. Blessed shalt thou be when thou
comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall cause thine enemies that rise up against
thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come out against
thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways. The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall command the blessing upon thee in thy barns,
and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto; and he shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">[68]</a></span>
bless thee in the land which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God giveth

unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt
keep the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, and walk
in his ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see
that thou art called by the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and they
shall be afraid of thee. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall make thee
plenteous for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the
fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the
land which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> sware unto thy fathers to give
thee. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall open unto thee his good treasury
the heaven to give the rain of thy land in its season, and
to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend
unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. And the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath;
if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and
to do them; and shalt not turn aside from any of the words
which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to
the left, to go after other gods to serve them.</p>

<p>But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto
the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God, to observe to do all his
commandments and his statutes which I command thee
this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and
overtake thee. Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and
cursed shalt thou be in the field. Cursed shall be thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">[69]</a></span>
basket and thy kneadingtrough. Cursed shall be the fruit
of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the increase of
thy kine, and the young of thy flock. Cursed shalt thou
be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when
thou goest out. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall send upon thee cursing,
discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thine
hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until
thou perish quickly; because of the evil of thy doings,
whereby thou hast forsaken me. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall make
the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed
thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it.
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall smite thee with consumption, and with
fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with
the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they
shall pursue thee until thou perish. And thy heaven that
is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under
thee shall be iron. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall make the rain of thy
land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down
upon thee, until thou be destroyed. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall cause
thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out
one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before
them: and thou shalt be tossed to and fro among all the
kingdoms of the earth. And thy carcase shall be meat
unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth,
and there shall be none to fray them away. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall smite thee with the boil of Egypt, and with the
emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, whereof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">[70]</a></span>
thou canst not be healed. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall smite thee
with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment
of heart: and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind
gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy
ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled
alway, and there shall be none to save thee. Thou shalt
betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou
shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou
shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof.
Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt
not eat thereof: thine ass shalt be violently taken away
from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee:
thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou
shalt have none to save thee. Thy sons and thy daughters
shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes
shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and
there shall be nought in the power of thine hand. The
fruit of thy ground, and all thy labours, shall a nation
which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
oppressed and crushed alway: so that thou shalt be mad
for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the
sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over
thee, unto a nation which thou hast not known, thou nor
thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">[71]</a></span>
and stone. And thou shalt become an astonishment, a
proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall lead thee away. Thou shalt carry much seed
out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust
shall consume it. Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress
them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather
the grapes; for the worm shall eat them. Thou shalt have
olive trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not
anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast its
fruit. Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they
shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity. All
thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess.
The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall
mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt
come down lower and lower. He shall lend to thee, and
thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou
shalt be the tail.</p>

<p>And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes
which he commanded thee: and they shall be upon thee
for a sign, and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
Because thou servedst not the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God with joyfulness,
and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance
of all things: therefore shalt thou serve thine
enemies which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall send against thee, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">[72]</a></span>
hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want
of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy
neck, until he have destroyed thee. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the
earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou
shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance,
which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew
favour to the young: and he shall eat the fruit of thy
cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed:
which also shall not leave thee corn, wine, or oil, the increase
of thy kine, or the young of thy flock, until he have
caused thee to perish. And he shall besiege thee in all
thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down,
wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he
shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land,
which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath given thee. And thou
shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons
and of thy daughters which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath given
thee; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine
enemies shall straiten thee. The man that is tender
among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward
his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward
the remnant of his children which he hath remaining: so
that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left
him; in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thine
enemy shall straiten thee in all thy gates. The tender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">[73]</a></span>
and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure
to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness
and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband
of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter;
and toward her young one that cometh out from
between her feet, and toward her children which she
shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things
secretly: in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith
thine enemy shall straiten thee in thy gates.</p>

<p>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law
that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this
glorious and fearful name, <span class="smcap">the lord thy god</span>; then the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,
and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. And he will
bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which
thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. Also
every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
the book of this law, them will the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bring upon thee
until thou be destroyed. And ye shall be left few in number,
whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;
because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
thy God. And it shall come to pass, that as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and
to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land
whither thou goest in to possess it. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">[74]</a></span>
scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the
earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou
shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou
nor thy fathers, even wood and stone. And among these
nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest
for the sole of thy foot: but the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall give thee there
a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul:
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou
shalt fear night and day, and shalt have none assurance
of thy life: in the morning thou shalt say, Would God it
were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were
morning! for the fear of thine heart which thou shalt fear,
and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. And
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no
more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your
enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen: and no man
shall buy you.</p>

<h5><i>A DISCOURSE ON</i></h5>
<p class="center"><i>IMMORTALITY AND THE COVENANT WITH</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>DEATH</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0"><i>Court not death in the error of your life;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Neither draw upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.</i><br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Because God made not death: neither delighteth he
when the living perish. For he created all things that
they might have being; and the generative powers of the
world are healthsome, and there is no poison of destruction
in them, nor hath Hades royal dominion upon earth:
for righteousness is immortal. But ungodly men by their
hands and their words called death unto them; deeming
him a friend they consumed away, and they made a
covenant with him because they are worthy to be of his
portion.</p>

<p>For they said within themselves, reasoning not aright:
"Short and sorrowful is our life; and there is no healing
when a man cometh to his end, and none was ever known
that gave release from Hades. Because by mere chance
were we born, and hereafter we shall be as though we
had never been; because the breath in our nostrils is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">[76]</a></span>
smoke, and while our heart beateth reason is a spark,
which being extinguished, the body shall be turned into
ashes, and the spirit shall be dispersed as thin air. And
our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall
remember our works; and our life shall pass away as the
traces of a cloud, and shall be scattered as is a mist,
when it is chased by the beams of the sun, and overcome
by the heat thereof. For our allotted time is the
passing of a shadow, and our end retreateth not; because
it is fast sealed, and none turneth it back. Come
therefore and let us enjoy the good things that now are;
and let us use the creation with all our soul as youth's
possession. Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and
perfumes, and let no flower of spring pass us by; let us
crown ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered;
let none of us go without his share in our proud revelry;
everywhere let us leave tokens of our mirth: because
this is our portion, and our lot is this. Let us oppress
the righteous poor: let us not spare the widow, nor
reverence the hairs of the old man gray for length of
years, but let our strength be to us a law of righteousness;
for that which is weak is found to be of no service.
But let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he
is of disservice to us, and is contrary to our works, and
upbraideth us with sins against the law, and layeth to
our charge sins against our discipline. He professeth to
have knowledge of God, and nameth himself servant of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">[77]</a></span>
the Lord. He became to us a reproof of our thoughts.
He is grievous unto us even to behold, because his life is
unlike other men's, and his paths are of strange fashion.
We were accounted of him as base metal, and he abstaineth
from our ways as from uncleannesses. The
latter end of the righteous he calleth happy; and he
vaunteth that God is his father. Let us see if his words
be true, and let us try what shall befall in the ending of
his life: for if the righteous man is God's son, he will
uphold him, and he will deliver him out of the hand of
his adversaries. With outrage and torture let us put him
to the test, that we may learn his gentleness, and may
prove his patience under wrong. Let us condemn him
to a shameful death; for he shall be visited according to
his words."</p>

<p>Thus reasoned they, and they were led astray. For their
wickedness blinded them; and they knew not the mysteries
of God, neither hoped they for wages of holiness, nor did
they judge that there is a prize for blameless souls. Because
God created man for incorruption, and made him an
image of his own proper being; but by the envy of the
devil death entered into the world, and they that are of his
portion make trial thereof.</p>

<p>But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them. In the eyes of the
foolish they seemed to have died; and their departure
was accounted to be their hurt, and their journeying away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">[78]</a></span>
from us to be their ruin: but they are in peace. For even
if in the sight of men they be punished, their hope is full
of immortality; and having borne a little chastening, they
shall receive great good. Because God made trial of them,
and found them worthy of himself; as gold in the furnace
he proved them, and as a whole burnt offering he accepted
them. And in the time of their visitation they shall shine
forth, and as sparks among stubble they shall run to and
fro. They shall judge nations, and have dominion over
peoples; and the Lord shall reign over them for evermore.
They that trust on him shall understand truth, and the
faithful shall abide with him in love: because grace and
mercy are to his chosen.</p>

<p>But the ungodly shall be requited even as they reasoned,
they which lightly regarded the righteous man, and revolted
from the Lord: for he that setteth at nought wisdom
and discipline is miserable. And void is their hope and
their toils unprofitable, and useless are their works. Their
wives are foolish, and wicked are their children; accursed
is their begetting.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For good labours have fruit of great
renown; and the root of understanding cannot fail. But
children of adulterers shall not come to maturity, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">[79]</a></span>
seed of an unlawful bed shall vanish away. For if they
live long they shall be held in no account, and at the last
their old age shall be without honour; and if they die
quickly they shall have no hope, nor in the day of decision
shall they have consolation. For the end of an unrighteous
generation is alway grievous. Better than this is
childlessness with virtue. For in the memory of virtue is
immortality, because it is recognised both before God and
before men; when it is present men imitate it, and they
long after it when it is departed; and throughout all time
it marcheth crowned in triumph, victorious in the strife for
the prizes that are undefiled. But the multiplying brood
of the ungodly shall be of no profit, and with bastard slips
they shall not strike deep root, nor shall they establish a
sure hold. For even if these put forth boughs and flourish
for a season, yet, standing unsure, they shall be shaken by
the wind, and by the violence of winds they shall be rooted
out. Their branches shall be broken off before they come
to maturity; and their fruit shall be useless, never ripe to
eat, and fit for nothing. For children unlawfully begotten
are witnesses of wickedness against parents when God
searcheth them out.
</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>Because happy is the barren that is indefiled, she who hath not conceived
in transgression; she shall have fruit when God visiteth souls. And
happy is the eunuch which hath wrought no lawless deed with his hands, nor
imagined wicked things against the Lord; for there shall be given him for
his faithfulness a peculiar favour, and a lot in the sanctuary of the Lord more
delightsome than wife or children.</p></div>

<p>But a righteous man, though he die before his time, shall
be at rest. For honourable old age is not that which
standeth in length of time, nor is its measure given by
number of years: but understanding is gray hairs unto men,
and an unspotted life is ripe old age. Being found well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">[80]</a></span>
pleasing unto God he was beloved of him, and while living
among sinners he was translated. He was caught away
lest wickedness should change his understanding, or guile
deceive his soul; for the bewitching of naughtiness bedimmeth
the things which are good, and the giddy whirl
of desire perverteth an innocent mind. Being made perfect
in a little while he fulfilled long years: for his soul was
pleasing unto the Lord; therefore hasted he out of the
midst of wickedness.</p>

<p>But as for the peoples, seeing and understanding not,
neither laying this to heart, that grace and mercy are with
his chosen, and that he visiteth his holy ones:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> they shall
see, and they shall despise; but them the Lord shall laugh
to scorn. And after this they shall become a dishonoured
carcase, and a reproach among the dead for ever. Because
he shall dash them speechless to the ground, and shall
shake them from the foundations, and they shall lie utterly
waste, and they shall be in anguish, and their memory shall
perish. They shall come, when their sins are reckoned
up, with coward fear; and their lawless deeds shall convict
them to their face. Then shall the righteous man stand
in great boldness before the face of them that afflicted him,
and them that make his labours of no account. When they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">[81]</a></span>
see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall
be amazed at the marvel of God's salvation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>But a righteous man that is dead shall condemn the ungodly that are
living, and youth that is quickly perfected the many years of an unrighteous
man's old age; for the ungodly shall see a wise man's end, and shall not
understand what the Lord purposed concerning him, and for what he safely
kept him.</p></div>

<p>They shall say within themselves, repenting, and for
distress of spirit shall they groan: "This was he whom
aforetime we had in derision, and made a parable of
reproach; we fools accounted his life madness and his
end without honour. How was he numbered among sons
of God? and how is his lot among saints? Verily we
went astray from the way of truth; and the light of
righteousness shined not for us, and the sun rose not for
us. We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction,
and we journeyed through trackless deserts;
but the way of the Lord we knew not. What did our
arrogancy profit us? and what good have riches and
vaunting brought us? Those things all passed away as
a shadow, and as a message that runneth by; as a ship
passing through the billowy water, whereof, when it is
gone by, there is no trace to be found, neither pathway
of its keel in the billows; or as when a bird flieth through
the air, no token of her passage is found, but the lightwind,
lashed with the stroke of her pinions, and rent
asunder with the violent rush of the moving wings, is
passed through, and afterwards no sign of her coming is
found therein; or as when an arrow is shot at a mark,
the air disparted closeth up again immediately, so that
men know not where it passed through: so we also, as
soon as we were born, ceased to be; and of virtue we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">[82]</a></span>
had no sign to shew, but in our wickedness we were
utterly consumed."</p>

<p>Because the hope of the ungodly man is as chaff carried
by the wind, and as foam vanishing before a tempest;
and is scattered as smoke is scattered by the wind; and
passeth by as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but
a day. But the righteous live for ever, and in the Lord is
their reward, and the care for them with the Most High.
Therefore shall they receive the crown of royal dignity and
the diadem of beauty from the Lord's hand; because with
his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall
he shield them. He shall take his jealousy as complete
armour, and shall make the whole creation his weapons for
vengeance on his enemies; he shall put on righteousness
as a breastplate, and shall array himself with judgement
unfeigned as with a helmet: he shall take holiness as an
invincible shield, and he shall sharpen stern wrath for a
sword. And the world shall go forth with him to fight
against his insensate foes. Shafts of lightning shall fly
with true aim, and from the clouds, as from a well-drawn
bow, shall they leap to the mark; and as from an engine
of war shall be hurled hailstones full of wrath; the water
of the sea shall be angered against them, and rivers shall
sternly overwhelm them; a mighty blast shall encounter
them, and as a tempest shall it winnow them away. And
so shall lawlessness make all the land desolate, and their
evil-doing shall overturn the thrones of princes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Hear therefore, ye kings, and understand; learn, ye
judges of the ends of the earth; give ear, ye that have
dominion over much people, and make your boast in multitudes
of nations. Because your dominion was given you
from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High,
who shall search out your works, and shall make inquisition
of your counsels; because being officers of his kingdom
ye did not judge aright, neither kept ye law, nor
walked after the counsel of God. Awfully and swiftly
shall he come upon you, because a stern judgement befalleth
them that be in high place: for the man of low
estate may be pardoned in mercy, but mighty men shall
be searched out mightily. For the Sovereign Lord of all
will not refrain himself for any man's person, neither will
he reverence greatness, because it is he that made both
small and great. And alike he taketh thought for all; but
strict is the scrutiny that cometh upon the powerful. Unto
you, therefore, O princes, are my words, that ye may learn
wisdom and fall not from the right way. For they that
have kept holily the things that are holy shall themselves
be hallowed; and they that have been taught them shall
find what to answer. Set your desire therefore on my
words; long for them, and ye shall be trained by their
discipline.</p>

<h5><i>ISAIAH'S DISCOURSE</i></h5>
<p class="center"><i>THE GREAT ARRAIGNMENT</i></p>

<p>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children,
and they have rebelled against me.</p>

<p>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's
crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a
seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly: they have
forsaken the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, they have despised the Holy One of
Israel, they are estranged and gone backward. Why will
ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The
whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the
sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
in it; but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they
have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified
with oil. Your country is desolate; your cities are burned
with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence,
and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. And the
daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge
in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. Except the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
should have been as Sodom, we should have been like
unto Gomorrah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Hear the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, ye rulers of Sodom; give
ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. To
what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams,
and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood
of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. When ye come to
appear before me, who hath required this at your hand,
to trample my courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense
is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath,
the calling of assemblies,&mdash;I cannot away with iniquity
and the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed
feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto
me; I am weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth
your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye
make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full
of blood.</p>

<p>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil: learn to
do well; seek judgement, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us
reason together, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing
and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: but
if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:
for the mouth of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken it.</p>

<p>How is the faithful city become an harlot! she that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">[86]</a></span>
full of judgement! righteousness lodged in her, but now
murderers. Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed
with water. Thy princes are rebellious, and companions
of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after
rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the
cause of the widow come unto them. Therefore saith the
Lord, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah,
I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of
mine enemies: and I will turn my hand upon thee, and
throughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all
thy alloy: and I will restore thy judges as at the first,
and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou
shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
Zion shall be redeemed with judgement, and her converts
with righteousness. But the destruction of the transgressors
and the sinners shall be together, and they that
forsake the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be consumed. For they shall be
ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall
be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. For
ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
that hath no water. And the strong shall be as tow, and
his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together,
and none shall quench them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE COVENANT WITH DEATH</i></p>

<p>Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim,
and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is
on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome
with wine! Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong
one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest
of mighty waters overflowing, shall he cast down to the
earth with the hand. The crown of pride of the drunkards
of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot: and the fading
flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the
fat valley, shall be as the firstripe fig before the summer;
which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet
in his hand he eateth it up.</p>

<p>In that day shall the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts be for a crown of
glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his
people: and for a spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in
judgement, and for strength to them that turn back the
battle at the gate.</p>

<p>But these also have erred through wine, and through
strong drink are gone astray; the priest and the prophet
have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of
wine, they are gone astray through strong drink; they err<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">[88]</a></span>
in vision, they stumble in judgement. For all tables are
full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.&mdash;'Whom
will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make
to understand the message? them that are weaned from
the milk, and drawn from the breasts? For it is precept
upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line
upon line; here a little, there a little.'&mdash;Nay, but by men
of strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to
this people: to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest
to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they
would not hear. Therefore shall the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be
unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little;
that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and
snared, and taken. Wherefore hear the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem:
Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with
death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing
scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto
us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood
have we hid ourselves: therefore thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>,
Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone,
a precious corner stone of sure foundation: he that believeth
shall not make haste. And I will make judgement
the line, and righteousness the plummet: and the hail shall
sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow
the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">[89]</a></span>
disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand;
when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye
shall be trodden down by it. As often as it passeth through,
it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass
through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but
terror to understand the message. For the bed is shorter
than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering
narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. For the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth
as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his
strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
Now therefore be ye not scorners, lest your bands be made
strong: for a consummation, and that determined, have I
heard from the Lord, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, upon the whole
earth.</p>

<p>Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear
my speech. Doth the plowman plow continually to sow?
doth he continually open and break the clods of his ground?
When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not
cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in
the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place
and the spelt in the border thereof? For his God doth
instruct him aright, and doth teach him. For the fitches
are not threshed with a sharp threshing instrument, neither
is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
rod. Is bread corn crushed? Nay, he will not ever be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">[90]</a></span>
threshing it, and driving his cart wheels and his horses
over it; he doth not crush it. This also cometh forth
from the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel,
and excellent in wisdom.</p>

<p>Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples:
let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
all things that come forth of it. For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath indignation
against all the nations, and fury against all their

them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast out,
and the stink of their carcases shall come up, and the

the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
of rams: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a
great slaughter in the land of Edom. And the wild-oxen
shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the
bulls; and their land shall be drunken with blood, and
their dust made fat with fatness. For it is the day of the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> vengeance, the year of recompence in the controversy
of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned
into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the
land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be
quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up
for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste;
none shall pass through it for ever and ever. But the
pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl
and the raven shall dwell therein: and he shall stretch
over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom,
but none shall be there; and all her princes shall be
nothing. And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles
and thistles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an
habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. And the wild
beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the
satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall
settle there, and shall find her a place of rest. There shall
the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
gather under her shadow: yea, there shall the kites be
gathered, every one with her mate.</p>

<p>And the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto me, saying, Son
of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word
toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of
Israel; and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">[94]</a></span>
Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my <span class="smcap">sword</span>

the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go
forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south
to the north: and all flesh shall know that I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not
return any more. Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with
the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou
sigh before their eyes. And it shall be, when they say
unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say,
Because of the tidings, for it cometh: and every heart
shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit
shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold,
it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto me again, saying,
Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways that the
sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall
come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark
it out at the head of the way to the city. Thou shall
appoint a way, for the sword to come to Rabbah of the
children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of
the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination:
he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim,
he looked in the liver. In his right hand was the divination
for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the
mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting,
to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up
mounts, to build forts. And it shall be unto them as a
vain divination in their sight, which have sworn oaths
unto them: but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that
they may be taken. Therefore thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097">[97]</a></span>
Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in
that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your
doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to
remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. And thou,
O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose
day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end; thus
saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>: Remove the mitre, and take off the
crown: this shall be no more the same: exalt that which
is low, and abase that which is high. I will overturn,
overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he
come whose right it is; and I will give it him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">4</p>

<p>And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith
the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> concerning the children of Ammon, and
concerning their reproach; and say thou:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0">'A sword, a sword is drawn,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'To cause it to devour,<br /></span>

</p></div></div>

<p>whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine lies
unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that
are deadly wounded, whose day is come, in the time of the
punishment of the end. (Cause it to return into its sheath.)
In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">[98]</a></span>

upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my

men, skilful to destroy. Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire;
thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be
no more remembered: for I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have spoken it.</p>

<h5><i>EZEKIEL'S DISCOURSE</i></h5>
<p class="center"><i>WRECK OF THE GOODLY SHIP TYRE</i></p>

<p>The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came again unto me, saying, And
thou, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre; and
say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea,
which art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles:
thus saith the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am
perfect in beauty. Thy borders are in the heart of the
seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. They have
made all thy planks of fir trees from Senir: they have
taken cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee. Of
the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have
made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the
isles of Kittim. Of fine linen with broidered work from
Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign;
blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">[99]</a></span>
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy
wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots. The
ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee
thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were
in thee to occupy thy merchandise. Persia and Lud and
Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the
shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls
round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: they
hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they
have perfected thy beauty. Tarshish was thy merchant by
reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver,
iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares. Javan,
Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers: they
traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy
merchandise. They of the house of Togarmah traded for
thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules. The
men of Dedan were thy traffickers: many isles were the
mart of thine hand: they brought thee in exchange horns
of ivory and ebony. Syria was thy merchant by reason
of the multitude of thy handyworks: they traded for thy
wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine
linen, and coral, and rubies. Judah, and the land of
Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise
wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and
oil, and balm. Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude
of thy handyworks, by reason of the multitude of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
kinds of riches; with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright
iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise.
Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding.
Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants
of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in
these were they thy merchants. The traffickers of Sheba
and Raamah, they were thy traffickers: they traded for
thy wares with chief of all spices, and with all precious
stones, and gold. Haran and Canneh and Eden, the
traffickers of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were thy traffickers.
These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in
wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of
rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among
thy merchandise. The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans
for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished,
and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.</p>

<p>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east
wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. Thy riches,
and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots,
thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all
thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company
which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of
the seas in the day of thy ruin. At the sound of the cry
of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake. And all that handle
the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall
come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
land, and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee,
and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their
heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: and
they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them
with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness
of soul with bitter mourning. And in their wailing they
shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee,
saying, 'Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to
silence in the midst of the sea?' When thy wares went
forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou
didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of
thy riches and of thy merchandise. In the time that thou
wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy
merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of
thee. All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at
thee, and their kings are horribly afraid, they are troubled
in their countenance. The merchants among the peoples
hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt
never be any more.</p>

<p>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and whose
hope the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is. For he shall be as a tree planted by

Put thy trust in him, and he will help thee:
order thy ways aright, and set thy hope on him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">Wisdom's Way with her Children</span></p>

<p>Wisdom exalteth her sons, and taketh hold of them that
seek her. He that loveth her loveth life; and they that
seek to her early shall be filled with gladness. He that
holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and where he entereth,
the Lord will bless. They that do her service shall minister
to the Holy One; and them that love her the Lord
doth love. He that giveth ear unto her shall judge the
nations; and he that giveth heed unto her shall dwell
securely. If he trust her, he shall inherit her; and his
generations shall have her in possession. For at the first
she will walk with him in crooked ways, and will bring fear
and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline,
until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements:
then will she return again the straight way unto
him, and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets.
If he go astray, she will forsake him, and give him over to
his fall.</p>

<h3><a name="Prosperity_and_Adversity_are_from_the_Lord" id="Prosperity_and_Adversity_are_from_the_Lord"></a>ii</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">Prosperity and Adversity are from the Lord</span></p>

<p>There is one that toileth, and laboureth, and maketh
haste, and is so much the more behind. There is one
that is sluggish, and hath need of help, lacking in
strength, and that aboundeth in poverty; and the eyes of
the Lord looked upon him for good, and he set him up
from his low estate, and lifted up his head; and many
marvelled at him. Good things and evil, life and death,
poverty and riches, are from the Lord. The gift of the
Lord remaineth with the godly, and his good pleasure
shall prosper for ever. There is that waxeth rich by his
wariness and pinching, and this is the portion of his
reward: when he saith, I have found rest, and now will
I eat of my goods&mdash;yet he knoweth not what time shall
pass, and he shall leave them to others, and die. Be stedfast
in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax
old in thy work. Marvel not at the works of a sinner, but
trust the Lord, and abide in thy labour; for it is an easy
thing in the sight of the Lord swiftly on the sudden to
make a poor man rich. The blessing of the Lord is in
the reward of the godly; and in an hour that cometh
swiftly he maketh his blessing to flourish. Say not, What
use is there of me? And what from henceforth shall my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
good things be? Say not, I have sufficient, and from
henceforth what harm shall happen unto me? In the day
of good things there is a forgetfulness of evil things; and
in the day of evil things a man will not remember
things that are good. For it is an easy thing in the
sight of the Lord to reward a man in the day of death
according to his ways. The affliction of an hour causeth
forgetfulness of delight; and in the last end of a man is
the revelation of his deeds. Call no man blessed before
his death; and a man shall be known in his children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Against_Gossip" id="Against_Gossip"></a>iii</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">Against Gossip</span></p>

<p>He that is hasty to trust is lightminded; and he that
sinneth shall offend against his own soul. He that maketh
merry in his heart shall be condemned: and he that hateth
talk hath the less wickedness. Never repeat what is told
thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whether it be
of friend or foe, tell it not; and unless it is a sin to thee,
reveal it not: for he hath heard thee, and observed thee,
and when the time cometh he will hate thee. Hast thou
heard a word? let it die with thee: be of good courage,
it will not burst thee. A fool will travail in pain with a
word, as a woman in labour with a child. As an arrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that sticketh in the flesh of the thigh, so is a word in a
fool's belly. Reprove a friend: it may be he did it not,
and if he did something, that he may do it no more. Reprove
thy neighbour: it may be he said it not, and if he
hath said it, that he may not say it again. Reprove a
friend, for many times there is slander; and trust not
every word. There is one that slippeth, and not from
the heart; and who is he that hath not sinned with his
tongue? Reprove thy neighbour before thou threaten
him; and give place to the law of the Most High.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="On_the_Tongue" id="On_the_Tongue"></a>iv</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">On the Tongue</span></p>

<p>If thou blow a spark, it shall burn; and if thou spit
upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these shall come
out of thy mouth. Curse the whisperer and double-tongued:
for he hath destroyed many that were at peace.
A third person's tongue hath shaken many, and dispersed
them from nation to nation; and it hath pulled down
strong cities, and overthrown the houses of great men.
A third person's tongue hath cast out brave women, and
deprived them of their labours. He that hearkeneth unto
it shall not find rest, nor shall he dwell quietly. The
stroke of a whip maketh a mark in the flesh; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
stroke of a tongue will break bones. Many have fallen
by the edge of the sword; yet not so many as they that
have fallen because of the tongue. Happy is he that is
sheltered from it, that hath not passed through the wrath
thereof; that hath not drawn its yoke, and hath not been
bound with its bands. For the yoke thereof is a yoke
of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The
death thereof is an evil death; and Hades were better
than it. It shall not have rule over godly men; and they
shall not be burned in its flame. They that forsake the
Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn among them, and
shall not be quenched: it shall be sent forth upon them
as a lion, and as a leopard it shall destroy them. Look
that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns; bind
up thy silver and thy gold; and make a balance and a
weight for thy words; and make a door and a bar for thy
mouth. Take heed lest thou slip therein; lest thou fall
before one that lieth in wait.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Choice_of_Company" id="Choice_of_Company"></a>v</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">Choice of Company</span></p>

<p>Bring not every man into thine house; for many are the
plots of the deceitful man. As a decoy partridge in a cage,
so is the heart of a proud man; and as one that is a spy,
he looketh upon thy falling. For he lieth in wait to turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
things that are good into evil; and in things that are
praiseworthy he will lay blame. From a spark of fire a
heap of many coals is kindled; and a sinful man lieth in
wait for blood. Take heed of an evil-doer, for he contriveth
wicked things; lest haply he bring upon thee blame for
ever. Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will
distract thee with brawls, and estrange thee from thine
own.</p>

<p>If thou do good, know to whom thou doest it; and thy
good deeds shall have thanks. Do good to a godly man,
and thou shalt find a recompense; and if not from him,
yet from the Most High. There shall no good come to
him that continueth to do evil, nor to him that giveth no
alms. Give to the godly man and help not the sinner.
Do good to one that is lowly, and give not to an ungodly
man; keep back his bread, and give it not to him, lest he
overmaster thee thereby; for thou shalt receive twice as
much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him.
For the Most High also hateth sinners, and will repay
vengeance unto the ungodly. Give to the good man, and
help not the sinner.</p>

<p>A man's friend will not be fully tried in prosperity; and
his enemy will not be hidden in adversity. In a man's
prosperity his enemies are grieved; and in his adversity
even his friend will be separated from him. Never trust
thine enemy, for like as the brass rusteth, so is his wickedness:
though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
take good heed, and beware of him, and thou shalt be
unto him as one that hath wiped a mirror, and thou shalt
know that he hath not utterly rusted it. Set him not by
thee, lest he overthrow thee and stand in thy place; let
him not sit on thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy
seat, and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and
be pricked with my sayings. Who will pity a charmer
that is bitten with a serpent? or any that come nigh wild
beasts? Even so who will pity him that goeth to a
sinner, and is mingled with him in his sins? For a while
he will abide with thee, and if thou give way, he will not
hold out. And the enemy will speak sweetly with his
lips, and in his heart take counsel how to overthrow thee
into a pit; the enemy will weep with his eyes, and if he
find opportunity, he will not be satiated with blood. If
adversity meet thee, thou shalt find him there before thee;
and as though he would help thee, he will trip up thy heel.
He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper
much, and change his countenance.</p>

<p>He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled; and he that hath
fellowship with a proud man shall become like unto him.
Take not up a burden above thy strength; and have no
fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than thyself.
What fellowship shall the earthen pot have with
the kettle? this shall smite, and that shall be dashed in
pieces. The rich man doeth a wrong, and he threateneth
withal: the poor is wronged, and he shall entreat withal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
If thou be profitable, he will make merchandise of thee;
and if thou be in want, he will forsake thee. If thou have
substance, he will live with thee; and he will make thee
bare, and will not be sorry. Hath he had need of thee?
then he will deceive thee, and smile upon thee, and give
thee hope: he will speak thee fair, and say, What needest
thou? and he will shame thee by his meats, until he have
made thee bare twice or thrice. And at the last he will
laugh thee to scorn; afterward will he see thee, and will
forsake thee, and shake his head at thee. Beware that
thou be not deceived, and brought low in thy mirth. If a
mighty man invite thee, be retiring, and so much the more
will he invite thee. Press not upon him, lest thou be
thrust back; and stand not far off, lest thou be forgotten.
Affect not to speak with him as an equal, and believe not
his many words: for with much talk will he try thee, and
in a smiling manner will search thee out. He that keepeth
not to himself words spoken is unmerciful; and he will not
spare to hurt and to bind. Keep them to thyself, and take
earnest heed, for thou walkest in peril of thy falling.</p>

<p>Every living creature loveth his like, and every man
loveth his neighbour. All flesh consorteth according to
kind, and a man will cleave to his like. What fellowship
shall the wolf have with the lamb? so is the sinner unto
the godly. What peace is there between the hyena and
the dog? and what peace between the rich man and the
poor? Wild asses are the prey of lions in the wilderness;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
so poor men are pasture for the rich. Lowliness is an
abomination to a proud man; so a poor man is an abomination
to the rich. A rich man when he is shaken is held
up of his friends; but one of low degree being down is
thrust away also by his friends. When a rich man is
fallen, there are many helpers; he speaketh things not
to be spoken, and men justify him: a man of low degree
falleth, and men rebuke him withal; he uttereth wisdom,
and no place is allowed him. A rich man speaketh, and
all keep silence; and what he saith they extol to the
clouds: a poor man speaketh, and they say, Who is this?
and if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him. Riches
are good that have no sin; and poverty is evil in the
mouth of the ungodly.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Wisdom_of_Business" id="The_Wisdom_of_Business"></a>vi</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">The Wisdom of Business and the Wisdom of Leisure</span></p>

<p>The wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of
leisure; and he that hath little business shall become
wise. How shall he become wise that holdeth the plow,
that glorieth in the shaft of the goad, that driveth oxen,
and is occupied in their labours, and whose discourse is of
the stock of bulls? He will set his heart upon turning his
furrows; and his wakefulness is to give his heifers their
fodder. So is every artificer and workmaster, that passeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his time by night as by day; they that cut gravings of
signets, and his diligence is to make great variety; he will
set his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture, and
will be wakeful to finish his work. So is the smith
sitting by the anvil, and considering the unwrought iron;
the vapour of the fire will waste his flesh, and in the heat
of the furnace will he wrestle with his work; the noise of
the hammer will be ever in his ear, and his eyes are upon
the pattern of the vessel; he will set his heart upon perfecting
his works, and he will be wakeful to adorn them
perfectly. So is the potter sitting at his work, and turning
the wheel about with his feet, who is alway anxiously set
at his work, and all his handywork is by number; he will
fashion the clay with his arm, and will bend its strength in
front of his feet; he will apply his heart to finish the
glazing, and he will be wakeful to make clean the furnace.
All these put their trust in their hands; and each becometh
wise in his own work. Without these shall not a city be
inhabited, and men shall not sojourn nor walk up and down
therein. They shall not be sought for in the council of
the people, and in the assembly they shall not mount on
high, they shall not sit on the seat of the judge, and they
shall not understand the covenant of judgement; neither
shall they declare instruction and judgement, and where
parables are they shall not be found. But they will maintain
the fabric of the world; and in the handywork of their
craft is their prayer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Not so he that hath applied his soul, and meditateth in
the law of the Most High. He will seek out the wisdom
of all of the ancients, and will be occupied in prophecies.
He will keep the discourse of the men of renown, and will
enter in amidst the subtilties of parables. He will seek
out the hidden meaning of proverbs, and be conversant in
the dark sayings of parables. He will serve among great
men, and appear before him that ruleth. He will travel
through the land of strange nations; for he hath tried
good things and evil among men. He will apply his
heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will
make supplication before the Most High, and will open
his mouth in prayer, and will make supplication for his
sins. If the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the
spirit of understanding: he shall pour forth the words of
his wisdom, and in prayer give thanks unto the Lord. He
shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets
shall he meditate. He shall shew forth the instruction
which he hath been taught, and shall glory in the law of
the covenant of the Lord. Many shall commend his
understanding, and so long as the world endureth, it shall
not be blotted out; his memorial shall not depart, and his
name shall live from generation to generation; nations
shall declare his wisdom, and the congregation shall tell
out his praise. If he continue, he shall leave a greater
name than a thousand: and if he die, he addeth thereto.</p>

<p class="center"><i>An Essay with a Sonnet</i></p>

<p>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
eyes to behold the sun. Yea, if a man live many years, let
him rejoice in them all; and remember the days of darkness,
for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that
for all these things God will bring thee into judgement.

<span class="i2">My saviour, thou savest me from violence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will call upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who is worthy to be praised:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cords of Sheol were round about me:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In my distress I called upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yea, I called unto my God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he heard my voice out of his temple,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my cry came into his ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the earth shook and trembled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The foundations of heaven moved<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And were shaken, because he was wroth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And fire out of his mouth devoured:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Coals were kindled by it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bowed the heavens also, and came down;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thick darkness was under his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he made darkness pavilions round about him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thundered from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Most High uttered his voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lightning, and discomfited them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the channels of the sea appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The foundations of the world were laid bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the rebuke of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the blast of the breath of his nostrils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent from on high, he took me;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He drew me out of many waters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From them that hated me;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For they were too mighty for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came upon me in the day of my calamity:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was my stay.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For I have kept the ways of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And have not wickedly departed from my God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his judgements were before me:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I was also perfect toward him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I kept myself from mine iniquity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> recompensed me according to my righteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">According to my cleanness in his eyesight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the perfect man thou wilt shew thyself perfect;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For by thee I run upon a troop:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By my God do I leap over a wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for God, his way is perfect:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He is a shield unto all them that trust in him.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For who is God, save the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God is my strong fortress:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He maketh his feet like hinds' feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And setteth me upon my high places.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He teacheth my hands to war;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thy gentleness hath made me great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my feet have not slipped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have pursued mine enemies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And destroyed them;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have consumed them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smitten them through that they cannot arise:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yea, they are fallen under my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I might cut off them that hate me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They looked, but there was none to save;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, but he answered them not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
<span class="i2">I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strangers shall submit themselves unto me:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strangers shall fade away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall come trembling out of their close places.<br /></span></p>
<p>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> liveth; and blessed be my rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bringeth down peoples under me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou deliverest me from the violent man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, <span class="smcap">O Lord</span>, among the nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And will sing praises unto thy name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great deliverance giveth he to his king:<br /></span>

the terrible. I will make a man more rare than fine gold,
even a man than the pure gold of Ophir. Therefore I
will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is a jealous God and avengeth; the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
avengeth and is full of wrath; the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> taketh vengeance
on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is slow to anger, and great in power, and will
by no means clear the guilty: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath his way in
the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the
dust of his feet. He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,
and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and
Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. The
mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth
is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that
dwell therein. Who can stand before his indignation?
and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury
is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder
by him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble;
and he knoweth them that put their trust in him.</p>

<p>But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end
of the place thereof, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.</p>

full end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. For
though they be like tangled thorns, and be drenched as
it were in their drink, they shall be devoured utterly as
dry stubble. There is one gone forth out of thee, that
imagineth evil against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that counselleth wickedness.
Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: Though they be in full
strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut
down, and he shall pass away.</p>

<p>Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will
burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given commandment concerning
thee, that no more of thy name be sown; out of the house
of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten
image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</p>

<p><i>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they
sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is
gone up.</i></p>

<p><i>And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they
come to the pits, and find no water; they return with their
vessels empty: they are ashamed and confounded, and
cover their heads.</i></p>

<p><i>Because of the ground which is chapt, for that no rain
hath been in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they
cover their heads.</i></p>

<p><i>Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her
young, because there is no grass. And the wild asses stand
on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their
eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Repentant Israel</span></p>

<p>Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for
thy name's sake, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: for our backslidings are many;
we have sinned against thee. O thou hope of Israel, the
saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that
turneth aside to tarry for a night? Why shouldest thou be
as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet
thou, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, art in the midst of us, and we are called by
thy name: leave us not.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto this people, Even so have they
loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> doth not accept them; now will he remember
their iniquity, and visit their sins.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span> (<i>to the Prophet</i>)</p>

<p>Pray not for this people for their good. When they
fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt
offering and oblation, I will not accept them: but I will
consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by
the pestilence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>Ah, Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>! behold, the prophets say unto them,
Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine;
but I will give you assured peace in this place.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span></p>

<p>The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them
not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
them; they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination,
and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own
heart. Therefore thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> concerning the
prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not,
yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land:
By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out
in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the
sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their
wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour
their wickedness upon them. And thou shalt say this
word unto them, 'Let mine eyes run down with tears night
and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter
of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very
grievous wound. If I go forth into the field, then behold
the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then
behold them that are sick with famine! for both the
prophet and the priest go about in the land and have
no knowledge.'</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Repentant Israel</span></p>

<p>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed
Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing
for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for
a time of healing, and behold dismay! We acknowledge,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers:
for we have sinned against thee. Do not abhor us, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
thy name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory:
remember, break not thy covenant with us. Are there
any among the vanities of the heathen that can cause rain?
or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
our God? therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou hast
made all these things.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span> (<i>to the Prophet</i>)</p>

<p>Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my
mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of
my sight, and let them go forth. And it shall come to
pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth?
then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: Such as
are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to
the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine;
and such as are for captivity, to captivity. And I will appoint
over them four kinds, saith the Lord: the sword to
slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven,
and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all
the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son
of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem?
or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall turn aside to ask
of thy welfare? Thou hast rejected me, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out
my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with repenting. And I have fanned them with a fan in
the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I
have destroyed my people; they have not returned from
their ways. Their widows are increased to me above the
sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the
mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have
caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly. She
that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the
ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she
hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of
them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man
of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I
have not lent on usury, neither have men lent to me on
usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span> (<i>to the Prophet</i>)</p>

<p>Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will
cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the
time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span> (<i>to the People</i>)</p>

<p>Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy
borders. And I will make thee to serve thine enemies in
a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in
mine anger, which shall burn upon you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Repentant Israel</span></p>

<p>O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me,
and avenge me of my persecutors: take me not away in
thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered
reproach. Thy words were found, and I did eat them;
and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of
mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> God of
hosts. I sat not in the assembly of them that make
merry, nor rejoiced: I sat alone because of thy hand; for
thou hast filled me with indignation. Why is my pain
perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be
healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook,
as waters that fail?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span></p>

<p>Therefore thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: If thou return, then will
I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and
if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be
as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt
not return unto them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">The Mystery</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear?
I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to look
upon perverseness? for spoiling and violence are before
me: and there is strife, and contention riseth up. Therefore
the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go
forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
therefore judgement goeth forth perverted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span></p>

<p>Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder
marvellously: for I work a work in your days, which ye
will not believe though it be told you. For, lo, I raise up
the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation; which march
through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling
places that are not theirs. They are terrible and dreadful:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
their judgement and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and
are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen
bear themselves proudly: yea, their horsemen come
from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.
They come all of them for violence; their faces are set
eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as
the sand. Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a
derision unto him: he derideth every strong hold; for
he heapeth up dust, and taketh it. Then shall he sweep
by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty: even
he whose might is his god.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>Art not thou from everlasting, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, mine
Holy One? thou diest not. O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou hast ordained
him for judgement; and thou, O Rock, hast established
him for correction. Thou that art of purer eyes than to
behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness,
wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,
and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up
the man that is more righteous than he; and makest men
as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have
no ruler over them? He taketh up all of them with the
angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in
his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad. Therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his
drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his meat
plenteous. Shall he therefore empty his net, and not
spare to slay the nations continually?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="tall">The Solution</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prophet</span></p>

<p>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower,
and will look forth to see what he will speak by me, and
what I shall answer concerning my complaint.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span></p>

<p>Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he
may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for the
appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall
not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
come, it will not delay. Behold, his soul is puffed up,
it is not upright in him: but the just shall live in his
faithfulness. Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer,
a haughty man, and that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth
his desire as hell, and he is as death, and cannot
be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
unto him all peoples. Shall not all these take up a
parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him,
and say:</p>

<p>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact usury

for booties unto them? Because thou hast spoiled many
nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee;

this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?
they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. I
hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man
repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?
every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth
headlong in the battle. Yea, the stork in the heaven
knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the
swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming;
but my people know not the ordinance of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. How
do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is with
us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought
falsely. The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed
and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
and what manner of wisdom is in them? Therefore will I
give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that
shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto
the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet
even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. And they
have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people lightly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. Were they
ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time
of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
I will utterly consume them, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: there shall
be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the
leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them
shall pass away from them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The People</span></p>

<p>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us

for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God hath put us to silence, and given us
water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the

is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of

daughter of my people! Oh that I had in the wilderness
a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lord</span></p>

<p>For they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not

brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will go
about with slanders. And they will deceive every one his
neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught
their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to

through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the

I will melt them, and try them; for how else should I do,
because of the daughter of my people? Their tongue is a
deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably
to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth
wait for him. Shall I not visit them for these things? saith

<h4><i>The Metrical System of Biblical Verse</i></h4>

<p>In the strictest sense the term 'metrical' is not applicable to
Biblical verse, since this is constituted, not by any numbering
of syllables, but by the parallelism of whole clauses.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0"><i>The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of Hosts is with us,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The God of Jacob is our refuge.</i><br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>This is verse, not in virtue of any particular number of syllables
in the lines, but because the second line is felt to run parallel
with the first. This principle of parallelism of clauses underlies
the whole of versification in Scriptural literature. As however
the different modes of combination and variation of these parallel
lines in Biblical poetry correspond, to a large extent, with
those of metrical lines in other languages, it is convenient to
speak of the principles governing them as a 'metrical system.'</p>

<p>One consequence however of the difference between Biblical
and other verse should always be borne in mind. The parallelism
of clauses, which makes the foundation of Hebrew verse, is
also a thing proper to oratorical prose in all languages. Accordingly
in Hebrew prose and verse overlap: the extremes of either
(e.g. <i>Psalms</i> and <i>Chronicles</i>) are strongly contrasted, but there
is a middle style which can be presented in either form. Hence
there is nothing strange in the fact that the same passage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Scripture may be presented by one editor as prose and by
another as verse, according to the purpose of each arrangement.
[For example: the Oration on Immortality (page 75),
which for a specimen of oratory is here arranged as prose, is
printed as verse in the Revised Version of the Apocrypha.]</p>

<p>1. The simplest type of parallelism in Biblical literature may
be called 'Antique Rhythm.' It is the metre of most of the
traditional poetry preserved in the historic books of Scripture.
Its unit consists in a couplet, of which either member may be
strengthened by a parallel line, but not both.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0"><i>Let me die the death of the righteous.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And let my last end be like his!</i><br /></span></p>
<p>
<span class="i0"><i>He saith, which heareth the words of God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which seeth the vision of the Almighty,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Falling down, and having his eyes open.</i><br /></span></p>
<p>
<span class="i0"><i>He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And shall break their bones in pieces,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And smite them through with his arrows.</i><br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Such a unit may be called a 'strain.' It will be seen in the
examples that the first strain is a simple couplet, the second has
its first line strengthened, the last has its second line strengthened.
This power of occasionally strengthening either line of
a couplet by an additional line gives the Antique Rhythm a
flexibility suited to spontaneous composition. A similar device<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
is found in connection with the traditional ballad poetry of
England, of which such collections as <i>The Percy Reliques</i> are
accidentally preserved specimens. While the regular metre of
such ballads is a four-line stanza, yet a few poems, such as the
Ballad of Sir Cauline, show some stanzas with individual lines
strengthened:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0"><i>Fair Christabel, that lady mild,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Was had forth of her tower;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But ever she droopeth in her mind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As nipt by an ungentle wind</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Doth some pale lily flower.</i><br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The poetry of the historic books mostly takes the form of
aggregations of such 'strains' of Antique Rhythm, with no further
structure. Occasionally such a poem will fall into verse
paragraphs or 'strophes' [to be distinguished from the antistrophic
system presently to be described]: an example is
David's Song of Victory (see note on page <a href="#Page_266">266</a>). [For a combination
of Antique Rhythm and the Antistrophic system, see
note to vii on page <a href="#Page_267">267</a>.]</p>

<p>2. The metre of Wisdom verse is highly elaborate: we find
here, not only the parallelism of successive clauses, but the
'high parallelism' which correlates all parts of a whole poem
with one another. Two types may be distinguished: the Stanza
structure and the Antistrophic structure.</p>

<p>Stanzas are familiar to the English reader: in Biblical poetry
groups of three lines, or four lines, etc., recur in succession: a
simple example is the Chorus of Watchmen (on page <a href="#Page_236">236</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The Antistrophic system is familiar to students of Greek, as
the metrical form of tragic choral odes. In this case the stanzas
run in pairs, strophe and antistrophe, the theory being that the
antistrophe exactly repeats the metrical form of its strophe; if
another strophe follows the form may altogether change, but
the changed form will be repeated in the corresponding antistrophe.
[This may be expressed by the formula <i>a a', b b', c c'</i>,
etc.] Besides the pair of strophes there may be an introduction,
or conclusion, or both. No. i of the Sonnets (on page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>) is
an example of a poem consisting simply of strophe and antistrophe;
No. iii (page 126) has also a conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>The term <i>strophe</i> is the Greek for 'turning': the system is derived from
the dance performance of Greek odes, according to which the chorus danced
from the altar to the end of the orchestra in one stanza, then 'turned,' and
<i>retraced their steps</i> for the antistrophe or 'answering' stanza. The term
<i>strophe</i> has come to be used also for verse paragraphs where there is no
antistrophic arrangement. (See page 266, note on vi.)</p></div>

<p>Both in the case of the Stanza structure and the Antistrophic
structure there are various modifications and elaborations&mdash;duplication,
inversion, interruption, etc.: these it will be sufficient
to explain in connection with the examples in which they are
found.</p>

<p>3. The metre of Lyrics is in the main the same as that of
Wisdom poetry. But in the strictest kinds of lyrics the structure
is further determined by the musical performance. A lyric may
be a solo, or the matter may be arranged for 'antiphonal' performance
between different performers, <i>e.g.</i> choruses of Men
and of Women. Antiphonal and antistrophic structure go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
easily together: see Deborah's Song, page <a href="#Page_152">152</a>. The musical
performance also introduces the 'refrain,' a passage recurring
(with or without changes for musical effect): for example see
The Song of Moses and Miriam (page 149).</p>

<p>4. A characteristic metrical system in Biblical verse is the
'Doom form.' Here the thread of the poem is in what, for
form and spirit, may be called prose; but this prose is interrupted
at intervals by lyric verse, celebrating or realising what
the prose brings forward. This is chiefly found in prophecies
of 'doom,' or denunciation of the foes of Israel (hence the
name): the prose is a Divine word of denunciation, the lyrics
are mostly impersonal celebrations of what the Divine speaker
says. The form is easily collected from examples; see pages
175-181.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>STORY</b></p>

<p>Story as a form of literature differs from History by its appeal
to the imagination and emotions, whereas History addresses
itself to our sense of record and scientific explanation. It is of
no consequence whether the matter of the story be historic fact
or invention; in the one case the writer selects, in the other case
he frames, such details as will have the desired effect in presenting
the story to the mind of the reader. The stories of the
Bible are scattered through the history, of which they form a
part; thus a reader of the Bible in its ordinary versions may be
required at any moment to alter the character of his attention
without anything to warn him of the change. In the Modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Reader's Bible (volumes <i>Genesis</i>, <i>The Exodus</i>, <i>The Judges</i>, <i>The
Kings</i>) the stories are separated from the surrounding matter by
titles. Selections of these stories enter into the present volume.</p>

<p><b>i. Joseph and his Brethren.</b> This is one of the most elaborate
and artistically beautiful stories in all literature. It emphasises
an important place in the Biblical history, Joseph being a
link between the Children of Israel and the world empire of
Egypt. Among elements of story beauty note the personality of
Joseph, its attractiveness wherever he goes and its gradual
maturing. Note also the sketches of varied life which make a
background to the story as it moves along&mdash;glimpses of shepherd
life, of caravan trading, of palace life in Egypt. But the
main interest will be the 'plot'&mdash;the technical term for the
harmony that binds the different parts of a story into one whole.
In the present case there are three 'motives' underlying the
plot. (1) What has been called the 'oracular action': the interest
of mystic dream oracles gradually becoming clear as the
oracles are fulfilled. (2) The development of an ironic situation&mdash;Joseph
recognising his brethren but not recognised by
them: once developed this situation is prolonged to the utmost
by the hero's conflict of feelings, between resentment and family
affection. (3) Beneath all other motives is the providential
overruling of human events for high purposes (compare
page <a href="#Page_027">27</a>).</p>

<p><b>ii. The Witness of Balaam.</b> The place of this story in the
main history is indicated by its title: the 'Exodus' is the period
of development for Israel from a family to a nation, and towards
the close of the period Balaam, an outsider, bears witness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
spite of himself to the growing numbers of the nation and to its
glorious future.&mdash;In literary form it is a 'mixed epic' or 'canti-fable':
a story in prose that breaks into verse at appropriate
places. (Compare the expression <i>took up his parable</i>: the
<i>parable</i> is an undefined term for a more specialised literary form
occurring in the course of more general literature, such as a
fable in the midst of a discourse, or a poem in the midst of
prose.)&mdash;Its interest rests partly upon the conception of the
'Blessing and the Curse': there is the superstitious idea of the
efficacy of these in the minds of Balak and his people, while
the true Blessing comes from the prophetic vision accorded to
Balaam by God. [Compare 'The Stolen Blessing' in the
<i>Genesis</i> volume.] In character Balaam is a sincere worshipper
of Jehovah outside the ranks of Jehovah's people, who however
from interested motives conforms to the heathen world around
him as far as he can. [Outside this story the general history
shows him as yielding at last to material interest and acting
as tempter to Israel: compare <i>Revelation</i>, chapter ii. 14.]&mdash;The
third paragraph (page 34) is the famous story of Balaam's
Ass. It is the opinion of some that this is a fable interwoven
with the main story: it is in favour of this view that the following
paragraph, <i>So Balaam went with the princes of Balak</i>, etc.,
seems the natural continuation of the second paragraph; while
the <i>princes of Balak</i> are ignored in the story of the Ass.</p>

<p><b>iii. The Crowning of Abimelech.</b> This occupies an important
place in the general history. Originally Israel is ruled
only by the invisible Jehovah; gradually the secularising forces
around lead to the institution of visible kings. This story is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
first attempt at crowning a king, the work of a faction, with
civil war and ruin as a result.&mdash;It is a story of war and adventure.
[Compare the Raid on Michmash, or The Feud of Saul
and David in the <i>Judges</i> volume.]&mdash;Its interest also rests upon
the bitter fable of Jotham in scorn of kingship: the fable has
the effect of a curse since it is literally fulfilled.</p>

<p><b>iv. Samson's Wedding Feast.</b> This illustrates a variety of
story called 'Idyl': the word is almost equivalent to 'trifle,' and
the term is applied to incidents of love or domestic life in contradistinction
to graver matters of history. [Three Idyl Stories
(<i>Ruth</i>, <i>Esther</i>, <i>Tobit</i>) are contained in the <i>Biblical Idyls</i> volume
of this series.]&mdash;Characteristic of such a story is the game
of riddles; the original riddle, answer, and rejoinder are all in
single couplets.&mdash;It is not a pure idyl; feats of hero strength
form another interest, as with other stories of Samson.</p>

<p><b>v-vii.</b> These are Prophetic Stories. As the secularising tendency
in Israel towards visible kings prevails against the original
conception of a spiritual rule by an invisible God there arises
an order of 'prophets,' who stand forth as representatives of the
invisible Jehovah, and are thus often in opposition to the external
government. So in the history of <i>The Kings</i> stories of
these prophets, with their miraculous powers, take the place of
the stories of heroes and their feats in earlier parts of the history.
During the captivity in Babylon, Daniel in a similar way
represents the Hebrew God against the king and hierarchy of
Babylon.</p>

<p><b>vii. Page 63.</b> I have followed a tradition that the mystic
writing on the wall was interpreted by Daniel reading downward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
instead of across [or rather, down, up, down: the form of
writing known as <i>boustrophedon</i>, that is, the way an ox turns in
a furrow]. If the handwriting was in an unknown alphabet
Daniel must have said so, or why should his interpretation be
accepted at once? But if the characters were those to which
the beholders were accustomed, but arranged in an unthought-of
direction, it is easy to realise the puzzle of the audience and the
instantaneous acceptance of the solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>ORATORY</b></p>

<p><b>i. The Oration of Moses at the Rehearsal of the Blessing
and the Curse.</b> The <i>Book of Deuteronomy</i>, from which this is
taken, is a collection of the Orations and Songs of Moses, constituting
his Farewell to the People of Israel. The general subject
both of the oratory and song is the Covenant between
Jehovah and his people, now for the first time committed to
writing, and entrusted by the retiring leader of Israel to the Levites
and Elders. The third of these orations is connected with
a ceremonial occasion. An ordinance has been made for the
ceremony of 'The Blessing and the Curse' to be an institution
of the promised land: representatives of the Blessing are to
stand on one mountain and representatives of the Curse on the
opposite slope, the whole ritual solemnly enforcing the sanctity
of the Covenant. At present however the people are on the
wilderness side of Jordan; accordingly Moses arranges a <i>Rehearsal</i>
of this ceremony, on ground resembling the valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
between Ebal and Gerizim. This rehearsal is allowed to proceed
to a certain point when Moses stops it, and takes the subject
of the blessings and curses into his own hands. Hence the
abrupt commencement of this oration.&mdash;As elements of oratorical
beauty note (1) the interweaving and parallelism of sentences,
(2) the terrific crescendo and climax of denunciation.
The oration must be spoken to get the full effect.</p>

<p><b>ii. Immortality and the Covenant with Death.</b> This is
an example of the Written Address, Oratory that is not intended
to be spoken. It is one of a series of imaginary addresses by
King Solomon to the other rulers of the nations, constituting
a work entitled 'The Wisdom of Solomon' (in volume 3 of
the present series).&mdash;The author's style is distinguished by a
peculiar order of thought, according to which some of the leading
points of his argument take the form of digressions. The
thought of this discourse is that death is no part of the natural
order of the universe, but is introduced into the world by the
wickedness of men. The author imagines a monologue of the
wicked, led by despair of aught beyond the grave to a life of
luxury and oppression. Another imaginary monologue expresses
the feelings of the same wicked men as they awaken from death
to the life beyond. But as a digression between these two
monologues the author places his reflections on the 'hopes of
the ungodly,' that is, the substitutes in earlier thought for the
grand conception of a life beyond death. These substitutes are
(1) the living over again in posterity, (2) long life in this world.
With regard to the first he argues that the brood of the ungodly
is unstable and accursed: better is childlessness with virtue. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to the hopes of long life, he argues that the old age of the
wicked is without honour; whereas a life cut short may be a
life perfected.</p>

<p><b>iii-vii.</b> These are Prophetic Discourses. Considered as part
of the literature of Oratory these Prophetic Discourses hold an
intermediate position between the spoken and the written
address. What appears as a discourse in the books of the
prophets is probably not the exact report of a speech, but the
substance of a speech, or of several similar speeches, worked up
again into the style of a written address.</p>

<p><b>iii. The Great Arraignment.</b> This discourse of Isaiah
takes the form of a theme (God's arraignment of his people
as rebels) treated in four paragraphs: the prophet's remonstrance&mdash;repentance
by oblations&mdash;repentance of life&mdash;corruption
redeemed with judgment.</p>

<p><b>iv. The Covenant with Death.</b> The phrase <i>Covenant with
Death</i> in the title of this discourse of Isaiah has a different meaning
from the same phrase in the title of another discourse (ii).
In the latter it meant a supposed invitation to Death to come
as a friend, by those who were 'of his portion'; in the present
case it means an agreement with Death to pass by the supposed
speaker while he visits others.&mdash;This discourse illustrates what
is a characteristic feature of Hebrew literature&mdash;the 'pendulum
structure,' by which the thought alternates in successive paragraphs
between one and the other of two contrasting themes,
in this case between Judgment and Salvation. The prophet is
writing for the southern kingdom of Judah. Commencing with
the rival kingdom of northern Israel he denounces drunken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Ephraim, and how its crown of pride shall be trodden down
(Judgment). But (Salvation) there shall be a crown of glory
for the residue. Now he proceeds to Judgment upon Judah:
the drunken rulers who trust to a refuge of lies, which the overflowing
scourge shall sweep away. But there is Salvation for
the patient. This comfort is imparted in agricultural images:
the cruel plowing does not go on for ever, the gentle sowing
comes; there are sharp threshing instruments [for the guilty],
the gentle threshing with the rod for the precious cummin;
and even the threshing is not to crush, but to make corn fit for
bread.</p>

<p><b>v. The Utter Destruction and the Great Restoration.</b> A
discourse made by companion pictures linked together by two
parallel passages, each a parenthetic quintet, interrupting the
pictorial description, which is afterwards resumed, with words
emphasising the prophecy as a whole: <i>Seek ye out of the book
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and read</i> [how all these woes shall come to pass]
... <i>Strengthen ye the weak hands</i> [with these glorious promises].&mdash;Note
that <i>Edom</i> is only mentioned as typical of the foes
of Israel in general, the pictures being of universal destruction
and restoration. There is a similar use of Egypt and Edom as
types of all the foes of Israel in another discourse (page <a href="#Page_220">220</a>).</p>

<p><b>vi. The Sword of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</b> This is an illustration of a
very peculiar form of discourse, which is without parallel in
modern literature. Ezekiel is the great representative of 'Emblem
Prophecy,' that is, discourses which have for texts some
symbolic action or piece of dumb show. But in extreme examples
of Emblem Prophecy, like the present, symbolism pervades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the whole of the discourse: attitude, gesture, visible emblem,
sustained dumb show, song, are all mingled together and combined
with oratory.&mdash;The discourse falls into four parts. (1)
At the opening, the prophet sets his face toward Jerusalem:
there is no symbolic action beyond this. (2) But as the address
progresses, he suddenly draws forth a sword: this is the sword
of the Lord which is to go forth out of its sheath against all
flesh, and it will not return any more. Suddenly, the dramatic
speaker has identified himself with the victims of this Divine
sword: <i>Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of
thy loins</i>, etc. Now the theme of the sword is resumed, and
with it mingles what is evidently some military strain or folk-lore
song, of which the augmenting lines suggest the gathering
spirit of combat: <i>A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also
furbished</i>, etc. For a single moment the other side is presented&mdash;a
people careless and secure: <i>the Rod of my son</i> [they say]
<i>it contemneth every tree</i>. But the impending destruction continues
to gather force: <i>And it is given to be furbished that it
may be handled</i>, etc. There is a sudden change, and cries and
howls proclaim how the sword has fallen upon the people, and
the <i>Rod that contemneth</i> is no more. The emblematic movement
seems to become more and more rapid [through three
verses of the song: <i>And let the sword be doubled the third time</i>,
etc.].&mdash;(3) A total change here ensues. The sword now
becomes emblematic of the sword of Babylon; and the imaginary
picture is that of the conqueror arriving at the junction of
the ways and deciding by his omens to proceed against Jerusalem.&mdash;(4)
Once more there is a total change: the sword now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
stands for Israel's enemies, the children of Ammon, and the verse
conveys their boasting. But suddenly the prophetic speaker
plunges the sword into its sheath: so is symbolically introduced
the fate of Ammon to return to the land of his birth and perish
there.</p>

<p><b>vii. Wreck of the Goodly Ship Tyre.</b> This illustrates a
characteristic of Ezekiel's style by which, in place of visible symbolism,
illustrated by the last example, a single image is sustained
through the whole of a discourse. In the present case
it is the image of a ship. Tyre was the great maritime city of
antiquity: its grandeur is conveyed under the image of a ship
which all the nations of the known world combine to build and
load; the judgment is the wrecking of this goodly ship.</p>

<p><b>viii.</b> Amongst other things the prophetic books contain 'Sentences,'
that is, brief sayings of prophets, each like an epigram,
complete in itself. These no doubt passed from mouth to
mouth like proverbs, and were collected by the prophets. The
examples in this section are from the <i>Book of Jeremiah</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>WISDOM</b></p>

<p>'Wisdom' is the name given to the department of Biblical
literature which corresponds to Philosophy in modern literature.
It is however always philosophy in application to human life
and conduct.</p>

<p>The starting-point of Wisdom literature is the <b>Unit Proverb</b>,
which is a unit of thought in a unit of form. The unit of form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is the couplet or triplet of verse: see above, page <a href="#Page_242">242</a>. Examples
are given on pages <a href="#Page_107">107</a>-9. It will be seen that this Unit
Proverb is a meeting-point of prose and verse literature: its
form is verse, its matter (philosophy) belongs to the literature
of prose. Accordingly it is natural that the more extended
forms of Wisdom literature should take two directions: one on
the side of verse, the other on the side of prose.</p>

<p><b>Epigrams</b> and <b>Maxims</b>: examples of these are found on
pages <a href="#Page_109">109</a>-11. The Epigram is a verse saying, of a few lines in
length, in which two lines (not necessarily consecutive) are
capable of standing by themselves as a unit proverb. In the
examples given the two lines in each epigram that stand out on
the left may be read as a proverb complete in itself. Such a
germ proverb is the text of the epigram, the remaining lines
serve to expand this text. The corresponding prose form is the
Maxim, a unit proverb text with a brief prose comment.</p>

<p><b>Essays.</b> A more extended form of Wisdom literature, on the
side of prose, is the Essay. The word has various uses: the
Scriptural essays are not of the modern type (like those of
Macaulay or Emerson), but of the antique type like the essays
of Bacon. The title of an essay suggests a theme, on which the
rest is a prose comment. (Pages <a href="#Page_112">112</a>-24.)</p>

<p>Verse compositions consisting of comments upon themes are
in this series called <b>Sonnets</b>. In general literature the idea
underlying the Sonnet is the adaptation of the matter to the
outer form, as if a poet's thought were poured into special
moulds. In English and Italian sonnets there is only one such
form or mould&mdash;a sequence of 14 lines divided according to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
particular plan; the matter of these sonnets must be condensed
or expanded to suit this plan. The nearest approach to this in
Scriptural literature is the Fixed or Number Sonnet: the opening
of this suggests a number scheme, to which the rest conforms.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>
<span class="i0"><i>There be three things which are too wonderful for me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yea, four which I know not:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The way of an Eagle in the air;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The way of a Serpent upon a rock;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The way of a Ship in the midst of the sea;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the way of a Man with a Maid.</i><br /></span>
</p></div></div>

<p>The examples quoted in the present volume are different. They
may be called 'Free Sonnets': the moulding in these is to
nothing more restricted than 'high parallelism,' that is, not the
parallelism binding successive lines into a stanza, but the bond
which may correlate the most distant parts of a poem into a
single scheme. The scheme of parallelism for each sonnet will
be given in a separate note.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Essays</b></p>

<p><b>ii.</b> This essay touches upon what was the great difficulty to
early Hebrew thinkers: the visible prosperity of the wicked,
which seemed to them contrary to their conception of 'judgment'
or righteous providence. The author in this essay endeavours
to meet the difficulty by two thoughts: (1) how a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
change of fate at the very end of life may make all the difference;
(2) how the punishment may come in the next generation.&mdash;A
resemblance will be noted at one point to a parable of
the New Testament.</p>

<p><b>v.</b> An essay on the Choice of Company, in five paragraphs:
The danger of unknown company in a house&mdash;the good only
are proper objects of charity&mdash;friendship not trustworthy until
tested by adversity&mdash;the humble can only be defiled by contact
with the proud&mdash;like will to like, and riches cannot consort
with poverty.</p>

<p><b>vi.</b> This essay is founded upon the old conception of society
by which the educated formed a separate class&mdash;here called
'the scribes.' Translated into modern ideas of life the argument
would be that no life in any social station must be without
leisure, and on such leisure self-culture depends.</p>

<p><b>vii.</b> This section makes a transitional stage to the next division
of our selections, as it consists of an Essay containing a
Sonnet.</p>

<p>The argument of the whole is that Life is a thing of joy,
tempered by the sense of responsibility. The latter idea is conveyed
by the word 'judgment,' which throughout the Old Testament
stands for the irreconcilable antagonism between good and
evil, and the certain overthrow of evil: the recognition of this
makes action responsible. With this limitation, the author
urges that the very shortness of life and youth is so much incentive
to make joyful what days are allowed.</p>

<p>The scheme of high parallelism [see above, page <a href="#Page_256">256</a>] in
this sonnet is the 'pendulum structure': the alternation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
successive lines between two thoughts is conveyed to the eye by
the indenting of the lines. The middle lines put symbolic descriptions
of old age; the lines indented on the left drop the
symbolism and speak in plain terms. [The lines indented on
the right are subordinate clauses.]</p>

<p>The matter of the sonnet is a <i>tour-de-force</i> of symbolism, under
which are veiled the symptoms of senile decay followed by
death. It is very likely that some of the symbols may be lost;
but it is not difficult to see, without straining, a possible interpretation
for each; and some of them have passed into traditional
use. The poetic beauty of the passage is marvellous.</p>

<p><i>Or ever the sun, and the light ... be darkened</i>: in view of
the opening words of the preceding essay, which take the
'light' and 'sun' as symbols of the whole happiness of conscious
existence, it is clear that the <i>darkening</i> of this light is the
gradual failing of the joy of living.&mdash;<i>And the clouds return
after the rain</i>: an exquisite symbol, closely akin to the last.
In youth we may overstrain and disturb our health, but we soon
rally; these are storms that quickly clear up. In age the rallying
power is gone: "the clouds return after the rain."&mdash;<i>The
keepers of the house shall tremble</i>: Cheyne understands of the
hands and arms, the trembling of which is a natural accompaniment
of old age.&mdash;<i>The strong men shall bow themselves</i>: the
stooping frame; the plural is merely by attraction to 'keepers.'&mdash;<i>The
grinders cease because they are few</i>: obviously of the
teeth.&mdash;<i>Those that look out of the windows be darkened</i>: the
eyes becoming dim.&mdash;<i>The doors shall be shut in the street</i>:
the general connection of ideas makes it inevitable that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
'folding-doors' should be the jaws; clenched jaws are so marked
a feature in the skull that it is not difficult to associate them
with the picture of old age.&mdash;<i>When the sound of the grinding
is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the
daughters of music shall be brought low</i>: these must be taken
together: appetite, speech, and sleep are all feeble. <i>Grinding</i>
must be interpreted as <i>grinders</i> in the previous part of the
sonnet: the loud or low sound of such grinding may fitly typify
the eagerness of appetite or the reverse. The early waking or
short sleeping of old age is well known. <i>The daughters of
music</i> are the tones of the voice.&mdash;<i>They shall be afraid of that
which is high, and terrors shall be in the way</i>: the gait of old
age is, through physical feebleness, much what the gait of a
person terrified is for other reasons.&mdash;<i>The almond tree shall
blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and the caperberry
shall burst</i>: the three are linked together as being images
from natural objects, not because of their symbolising similar
things. <i>The blossoming of the almond tree</i> probably refers to
the sparse white hairs of age. The name of this tree in Hebrew
is founded on the fact that it is the first to blossom; though not
strictly white, its blossoms may be called whitish: the whitish
blossoms, solitary while all is bare around, just yield the image
required. The <i>grasshopper</i> is evidently a symbol for a small
object, which is nevertheless heavy to feeble age. <i>The caperberry
shall burst</i>: the last stage of its decay: the failing powers
at last give way. And then follows the dropping of the symbolism:
"Man goeth to his long home."</p>

<p>So far we have had symbols for failure of powers; now for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
actual death and dissolution. <i>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or
the golden bowl be broken</i>: a symbol from the house-lamp of gold,
suspended by a silver cord, suddenly slipping its cord and breaking,
its light becoming extinguished. For <i>bowl</i> in this sense
compare <i>Zechariah</i>, chapter iv. 2, 3.&mdash;<i>Or the pitcher be broken
at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern</i>: these are exquisite
symbols for the sudden and violent cessation of every-day
functions. Compare the popular proverb: "The pitcher goes to
the well once too often."&mdash;<i>And the spirit return unto God who
gave it</i>: this by analogy with the previous line must be interpreted
to mean no more than that the man becomes just what
he was before he was born.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Sonnets</b></p>

<p><b>i. The Sluggard.</b> The metrical scheme of this sonnet is
simple: a strophe balanced by an antistrophe. [See above,
page <a href="#Page_244">244</a>.]</p>

<p><b>ii. The Mourning for the Fool.</b> Metrical scheme: a brief
strophe and antistrophe and conclusion.</p>

<p><b>iii. The Two Paths.</b> Strophe, the way of wisdom; antistrophe,
the path of the wicked; conclusion, union of the two
in a common image.</p>

<p><b>iv. The Creator has made Wisdom the Supreme Prize.</b>
The metrical scheme of this sonnet is an example of 'antistrophic
inversion': that is, two strophes followed by their
antistrophes, but the antistrophe to the second strophe precedes
the antistrophe to the first. [This is sometimes expressed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
formula <i>a b b a</i>; or (reckoning the number of lines in each
strophe) <i>4, 6; 6, 4</i>.] The printing makes this clear to the eye.&mdash;The
unity of thought in the sonnet is the conception of Wisdom
as a prize. The middle strophe and antistrophe describe
the richness of this prize; the opening strophe makes 'chastening'
the cost at which it is obtained by the individual from the
Lord; and the corresponding antistrophe (at the end) explains
the reason for this costliness&mdash;wisdom was the instrument by
which the whole universe was created.</p>

<p><b>v. Watchfulness of Lips and Heart.</b> A Prayer in sonnet
form. The metrical scheme is an illustration of 'duplication'
applied to antistrophic structure: a quatrain question (strophe 1)
has a couplet answer (strophe 2); then the quatrain is duplicated
into an octet (antistrophe 1), and the answer is duplicated
into a quatrain (antistrophe 2). [The lines of invocation are
not counted in strophe and antistrophe 2.]</p>

<p><b>vi. Wisdom and the Fear of the Lord.</b> This is one of the
most elaborate sonnets: its metrical scheme combines antistrophic
and stanza structure (above, page <a href="#Page_243">243</a>). There is first a strophe
with its antistrophe; then a series of stanzas; but these stanzas
illustrate the metrical device of 'augmenting,' for they increase,
as the thought gathers strength, from 3 lines to 5 lines and 6 lines.</p>

<p><b>vii. Wisdom and the Strange Woman.</b> This is at once the
foremost of wisdom poems in its thought, and the most elaborate
in sonnet structure: here, as always, the structure is an exact
reflection of the thought.</p>

<p>The metrical scheme shows stanza structure throughout. The
poem falls into seven sections. In sections 1, 3, 4, 7, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
contain the thread of argument, we find octet and ten-line
stanzas. Section 2, which breaks off from the argument to give
a picture of temptation, changes to sextet stanzas. Sections 5
and 6, the monologue of Wisdom, are cast in quatrains, but as
the monologue crescendoes to its climax the quatrains 'augment'
to 5, 6, 7 lines. There is further the artistic device of
'interruption': the regular flow of stanzas is broken at critical
points by single couplets (like musical rhythm interrupted by
recitative); again in section 2 the actual speech of the temptress
is an irregular mass of lines outside the stanza structure, and
this break in the flow of lines has a fine effect.</p>

<p>The thought of the poem is in the highest degree grand and
bold. Scriptural philosophy loves to celebrate under the name
'Wisdom' the union of all things, whether of the external universe
or of the spiritual life, in one Divine harmony. In this
poem this Wisdom is to be personified, and to proclaim her
attractions. But the poet prepares the way by contrast with the
spirit of temptation, also personified in female form practising
her allurements. This is displayed in a boldly drawn picture;
and then the poet, with the words <i>Doth not Wisdom cry?</i> suddenly
turns round and presents 'Wisdom' as the temptress to
good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>LYRICS</b></p>

<p><b>i-ii.</b> These two selections are from the <i>Book of Job</i>. This
consists of matter mainly philosophic worked up into an elaborate
poem in which all literary forms&mdash;epic, lyric, drama,
rhetoric, etc.&mdash;are blended in a way unparalleled in modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
literature. Hence the form of these two pieces is intermediate
between wisdom sonnets and the lyrical poems that follow.</p>

<p><b>i. An Elegy of a Broken Heart.</b> In the <i>Book of Job</i> this
intervenes between the Story Prologue, which is prose, and the
main body of the poem, which takes a dramatic form. Job
breaks the silence to dilate, with lyrical elaboration, upon the
situation of utter ruin which is to be the starting-point of the
dramatic discussion. Hence the title of the section in the whole
poem of <i>Job</i> is 'Job's Curse': but it admits of being separated
from the action of the drama as an independent poem, with
some such title as I have given it.&mdash;In metrical scheme it falls
into two sections. Section 1 is an example of 'interruption'
(compare note to vii of the sonnets). It will be seen that the
last two lines continue the sentence begun by the first two lines,
making with them a quatrain: between come masses of parallel
lines interrupting with a <i>tour-de-force</i> of execration. Section 2
is made up of introductory quatrain, strophe, and antistrophe.</p>

<p><b>ii. The Creator's Joy in his Creation.</b> This selection from
<i>Job</i> is a part of the 'Divine Intervention,' which may be read
as a complete poem. That drama introduces the Voice of God
out of the whirlwind as taking a part in the dialogue. The
link between the Divine Intervention as a whole and the general
argument is the impossibility of any mortal grasping the mysteries
of the universe, which mysteries enfold the glories of
nature as well as the dark ways of providence which Job and
his friends have been discussing. As a part of this general
thought the portion here cited works out the idea of the Creator's
joy in his creation&mdash;a joyous sympathy with the infinities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of great and small throughout the universe. It might be an
expansion of the words in the story of the creation: "And God
saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very
good."&mdash;The metrical scheme of this poem is a variation of the
'pendulum structure.' [Page 251.] It may be called a 'triple
pendulum,' or alternation between three notes: one note is made
by the startling questions of nature mysteries, another (lines
indented to the right) exquisitely pictures the details of these
wonders of nature, while for a third (lines still more to the
right) there is a word of challenge to Job to answer.</p>

<p><b>iii-v.</b> These three selections are lyrics in the strictest sense.
Originally all poetry is of the form technically called 'Ballad-Dance,'
that is, verse combined with musical accompaniment
and dancing. When this primitive poetry branches out into
other forms, lyric is the form which retains most of the musical
element. The poems here cited are lyrics in the strict sense
that their structure is determined by the mode of their musical
performance. This is seen by the 'antiphonal' distribution of
the matter, for example, between choruses of men and women,
and by the recurrence of passages ('refrains').</p>

<p><b>iii. Song of Moses and Miriam.</b> This is arranged for a
Chorus of Men, taking the successive sections of the song, and
a Chorus of Women, singing the refrain. The metre is Antique
Rhythm (above, page 242): the successive strophes augment
with the growing fulness of the theme. The first strophe (after
the prelude) simply states the fact of the deliverance; the second
pictures it in detail, the third meditates on the consequences
to the furthest future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<b>iv. Deborah's Song.</b> This also is arranged for a Chorus of
Men, led by Barak, and a Chorus of Women, led by Deborah.
It is in Antique Rhythm (above, page 242). Its structure is
antiphonal as between Men, Women, and the two combined.
The structure is further elaborated by 'interruption' [passages
printed in italics], where the singers encourage one another.</p>

<p>To appreciate the matter of the song it should be compared
with the description of the incident in plain historic prose
(<i>Judges</i>, chapter iv). It is not difficult to make out from this
narrative (1) that Heber the Kenite, Jael's husband, was acting
as a spy against his allies of Israel, and betraying their movements
to the tyrant. Jael's act was treachery in retaliation
for the treachery on the other side by her husband. This explains
the exultation over her deed in Deborah's Song.
(2) This treachery of Heber had upset the plans of Deborah
and Barak: helpless against the iron chariots, their only hope
had been to assemble secretly on the heights of Kedesh and attempt
a surprise. But while the army of Sisera, warned by
Heber, were awaiting them on the plains of Esdraelon, a sudden
thunder storm with rain (commemorated in the Song) converted
the whole plain into a morass. The army of Barak fell on the
foe while their horses were struggling in the mud, and extirpated
them at a blow.</p>

<p><b>v. David's Lament.</b> This simple elegy is cast in quatrain
stanzas. Its only elaboration is an augmenting refrain. This
beautiful refrain seems to rest for its effect upon the bringing
together of two ideas, like a crescendo and decrescendo in
music: <i>How are the mighty</i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>fallen!</i> This fragmentary refrain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
as it appears at the beginning is enlarged at the passage
from the section on Saul to that on Jonathan, and still further
enlarged at the close of the whole.</p>

<p><b>vi. David's Song of Victory.</b> This is in Antique Rhythm:
its structure is 'strophic' (above, page 243). There is an introduction
and conclusion, and three unequal strophes: the
first pictures the deliverance, the second meditates on the principle
involved (deliverance of the righteous), the third extends
the confidence thus produced to the whole past and future. The
most notable artistic effect is the sudden change at the prayer of
the afflicted one: all nature is convulsed as the Almighty rushes
to the rescue.</p>

<p><b>vii. The Bride's Reminiscences.</b> This is introduced as
an example of the Lyric Idyl. The term 'idyl' has been explained
above (page 248, note to iv): such idyls may be either
narrated as stories, or brought out lyrically or dramatically, as
in the present case. It is one of a series of lyric idyls making
up the poem of <i>Solomon's Song</i>. The story underlying this
poem has been variously interpreted; the interpretation followed
in this series (<i>Biblical Idyls</i> volume) is that King Solomon,
visiting his vineyards on Mount Lebanon, has come by surprise
upon a beautiful Shulammite maiden. As she flies from the
royal suite he seeks her in shepherd disguise and wins her love,
then he brings her as queen to his palace. The present selection
is Idyl II of the series, and contains two of the Bride's
Reminiscences of this courtship. The first is of a visit by the
disguised king on a fair spring morning, and how the lovers
were interrupted by the harsh voices of the Bride's Brothers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
crying out that the foxes were in the vineyards. The second is
a dream of losing and finding her lover. [The passages in
italics are not spoken by the Bride, but are the poet's interludes,
dividing the different sections of the poem.]&mdash;Metrical scheme.
The idyls are a combination of Antique Rhythm and Antistrophic
structure: but the parallelism of strophe and antistrophe must
be reckoned in <i>strains</i>, not in lines (see above, page 242): thus
we have four strains balanced by four, then two by two; then
(in the Dream) three by three. [The refrains are outside the
metrical scheme.]</p>

<p><b>viii, ix.</b> These are songs from the books of the prophets.</p>

<p><b>viii. The Battle of Carchemish.</b> This is a War Ballad, in
triplet stanzas with 'duplication.' The battle celebrated was a
turning-point in history, settling for ever the supremacy of the
Babylonian over the Egyptian empire: these were the two world
empires between which parties in the nation of Israel fluctuated,
the whole strength of Jeremiah and the prophetic party being
thrown against Egypt.</p>

<p><b>ix.</b> This <b>Song of Zion Redeemed</b> forms a section of the
Isaiahan 'Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed' [chapters xl-lxvi]. It
is in stanzas of 4, or occasionally 6 and 8 lines, the flow interrupted
by couplets, especially at the beginning of the sections.
Compare above, page 262, note to <b>vii</b> (Sonnets).</p>

<p><b>x, xi.</b> These are illustrations of a characteristic feature of
Biblical poetry&mdash;the 'Doom form.' See above, page 245.</p>

<p><b>x. Isaiah's Doom of Babylon.</b> The structure is made up
of the Divine word of the overthrow of Babylon [prose passages]
interrupted at intervals by [impersonal] songs, realising or celebrating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
what the Divine word brings forward. The last of these
verse interruptions is a fully developed Ode on Fallen Babylon.
The structural form of this ode is antistrophic inversion (7, 6;
6, 7), like that of No. <b>iv</b> of the Sonnets (above, page 260).
Another effect in this ode is the Taunt or Dirge Song.&mdash;<i>My
consecrated ones ... them that exult in my majesty.</i> The
Divine voice is heard calling to God's 'hosts,' the idea suggested
by the title 'Jehovah Sabaoth.' Compare <i>Joel</i>, chapter iii. 11
and 13; <i>Psalm</i> ciii. 20, 21.&mdash;<i>I will sit upon the mount of congregation
in the uttermost parts of the north</i>: the north is regularly
in Scripture the quarter from which Divine judgment is
looked for (e.g. <i>Ezekiel</i>, chapter i. 4; <i>Jeremiah</i> vi. i; <i>Job</i>
xxxvii. 22).</p>

<p><b>xi. Nahum's Doom of Nineveh.</b> This is a Doom Prophecy
directed against Nineveh, partly in the structure called above
'doom form,' partly in other forms. It falls into seven sections.
Sections 1 and 2 are meditations in pendulum form (above,
page 251), the paragraphs alternating between judgment and
salvation. Section 3 is in doom form: the Divine announcement
of doom is interrupted by lyric realisation of the sudden
attack upon Nineveh in the midst of its careless security. Section
4 is a brief lyric triumph over Nineveh overthrown. Section
5 resumes the doom form: the Divine denunciation interrupted
by lyric realisation of Nineveh in its pride. With section 6
this passes into a Taunt Song (as in example <b>x</b>). The seventh
section is a brief lyric meditation upon Nineveh overthrown and
desolate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><b>RHAPSODY</b></p>

<p>This has been explained in the Introduction (pages xii-xiii)
as a term applied to a highly characteristic form of prophetic
literature, amounting to spiritual drama: actual dramatic dialogue
and action being combined with other literary modes of
expression to produce the general effect of dramatic realisation
and movement. Some of the examples (I-III) are complete
rhapsodies; IV is a discourse that becomes rhapsodic at its
conclusion; V is a rhapsodic <i>morceau</i>, a single thought cast in
this literary form; VI and VII are integral portions of one of
the long rhapsodies.</p>

<p><b>I. Rhapsody of the Drought.</b> This is a simple and clear
example of rhapsodic writing. It opens with scenic description
of the drought; the rest is dialogue between God, Repentant
Israel, and the Prophet. The action of the rhapsody consists in
the gradual effect of intercession: God at first refuses so much
as to answer the sinful People, and speaks only through the
Prophet; at last he answers the People directly, but only to
threaten; finally he shows mercy to the repentant remnant.</p>

<p><b>II. Habakkuk's Rhapsody of the Chaldeans.</b> This is a
thoroughly typical and a splendid specimen of the rhapsody as
a form of literature, (1) The historic situation is the appearance
of the Chaldeans as a conquering power trampling down
surrounding nations. This suggests the thought of judgment
upon unpunished sin in Israel. But the Prophet feels a difficulty:
how can a righteous God use a godless people as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
instrument for the punishment of wickedness that is less than
its own? The elaboration of this spiritual problem, in dramatic
dialogue between God and the Prophet, makes the first section
of the rhapsody.&mdash;(2) The Divine solution of this problem
comes under the image of intoxication: the haughty career of
the Chaldean is no more than the drunkard's reeling which
precedes his fall. But as the idea of the fall of the Chaldean
is reached there is a sudden change from dialogue to the doom
form. This Doom of the Chaldeans has five stanzas of the
usual combination between prose and verse: the prose is
Divine denunciation, the verse passages are the imagined
triumphing of the down-trodden nations over their fallen
oppressor. Four of the stanzas express the fall of the Chaldean
in four images: his uninterrupted career has been a
heaping up of usury, but the exactor shall come; it has been
building a house of refuge, but shame has been built into its
walls; it has been building a huge city only to make a
bigger bonfire to the glory of the avenging God; it has been
giving drink to behold shame, but the drink of shame shall be
given to the oppressor. The fifth stanza goes to the root of the
matter: the Chaldean has trusted to senseless idols: Jehovah
is the true teacher.&mdash;(3) So far the overthrow of the Chaldeans
has been presented as a thing of the distant future; in the third
section it is realised as visibly present: thus the movement of the
rhapsody has been steadily advancing from the first forming of
a problem to the climax of its solution. The literary form now
changes to that of an Ode, realising the idea of Jehovah come
to judgment. The prelude and postlude express the Prophet's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
feelings at the vision he hears and sees; the body of the ode
realises the theophany itself. [Strophe, All nature convulsed as
God comes; antistrophe, Is it against nature that the coming
is directed? conclusion, Nay, but God comes to deliver his
people. Compare <i>Psalm</i> cxiv.]</p>

<p><b>Page 205.</b> <i>I have heard the report of thee.</i> This <i>report</i>, and
so <i>the voice</i> in the second line of the postlude, refer to the voice
supposed to sing what makes the body of the ode. This is the
voice of Israel, heard in the vision describing the advent of
Jehovah.&mdash;<i>O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> revive thy work in the midst of the years</i>:
compare on page 202 <i>though it tarry, wait for it</i>: the Prophet
prays God to interpose before it is too late.</p>

<p><b>Page 207.</b> <i>I trembled in my place</i>, etc. The Prophet has a
strange mingling of different feelings: terror at the vision of
Jehovah's advent, though it be for his deliverance, and confidence,
as a result of this vision, in the midst of desolation.</p>

<p><b>III. Joel's Rhapsody of the Locust Plague.</b> This rhapsody
may be founded on an historic plague of locusts, but the notion
is idealised into mystic forces of destruction. Nothing else in
the historic situation has any bearing on the rhapsody, it is
ideal all through: desolation because of sin, and 'judgment,' in
the double sense of first a judgment on Israel that is turned by
repentance to purification, then a judgment as between Israel
and the nations. As arranged in the text the movement of this
rhapsody explains itself.</p>

<p><b>VI.</b> This selection is the Prelude to the elaborate 'Rhapsody
of Zion Redeemed' [<i>Isaiah</i> volume, pages <a href="#Page_127">127</a>-209]. Like the
overture of many modern musical compositions, this Prelude is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a lyric anticipation or foreshadowing of the whole work. A
word of comfort for Jerusalem is spoken by God, and Voices are
heard carrying the glad tidings on the way towards Jerusalem.
The words spoken by these voices are anticipations of subsequent
parts of the rhapsody.</p>

<p><b>VII.</b> This selection is the third Act or 'Vision' of the same
rhapsody. It brings out in dramatic realisation the Awakening
of Zion. Successive appeals are made by Jehovah to Zion without
response. The Celestial Hosts join in the appeal: still
without response from Zion. At last the awakening of Zion is
brought out by the Chorus of Zion's Watchmen recognising the
advent of the messengers who bring the glad tidings (compare
the Prelude), and calling upon the city to awake and rejoice.</p>

<h2>The Modern Reader's Bible.</h2>
<p class="center">A Series of Books from the Sacred Scriptures,</p>
<p class="center">presented in Modern Literary Form,</p>
<p class="center">BY</p>
<p class="center">RICHARD G. MOULTON,</p>
<p class="center">M.A. (Camb.), Ph.D. (Penn.),</p>
<p class="center"><i>Professor of Literature in English in the University of Chicago.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
<p><b>The Outlook, New York.</b></p>

<p>"The effect of these changes back to the original forms under
which the sacred writings first appeared will be, for the vast majority
of readers, a surprise and delight; they will
feel as if they had come upon new spiritual and
intellectual treasures, and they will appreciate for
the first time how much the Bible has suffered
from the hands of those who have treated it without reference to its
literary quality. In view of the significance and possible results of
Professor Moulton's undertaking, it is not too much to pronounce
it one of the most important spiritual and literary events of the
times. It is part of the renaissance of Biblical study; but it may
mean, and in our judgment it does mean, the renewal of a fresh and
deep impression of the beauty and power of the supreme spiritual
writing of the world."</p>

<p><b>Presbyterian and Reformed Review.</b></p>

<p>"Unquestionably here is a task worth carrying out: and it is to
be said at once that Dr. Moulton has carried it
out with great skill and helpfulness. Both the
introduction and the notes are distinct contributions
to the better understanding and higher
appreciation of the literary character, features
and beauties of the Biblical books treated."</p>
